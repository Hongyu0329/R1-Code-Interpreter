    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Ion (M⁺) and Molecular Weight**\n\n1.  The mass spectrum shows a series of peaks at the high mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) end. The highest significant cluster starts around m/z 260.\n2.  We observe a distinct pattern of peaks at m/z 260, 262, 264, and 266. This pattern, with peaks separated by 2 mass units, is characteristic of a compound containing chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br).\n3.  Chlorine has two main isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75.8%) and ³⁷Cl (~24.2%), in an approximate 3:1 ratio. Bromine has two isotopes, ⁷⁹Br and ⁸¹Br, in an approximate 1:1 ratio.\n4.  Let's analyze the isotopic cluster starting at m/z 260:\n    *   m/z 260: I = 34.8%\n    *   m/z 262: I = 29.0%\n    *   m/z 264: I = 12.9%\n    *   m/z 266: I = 3.22%\n5.  The theoretical intensity ratio for a molecule with three chlorine atoms (M, M+2, M+4, M+6) is approximately (3:1)³ which gives a ratio of 27:27:9:1.\n6.  The experimental ratio of the peak intensities (34.8 : 29.0 : 12.9 : 3.22) is approximately 10.8 : 9.0 : 4.0 : 1. This closely matches the theoretical ratio for three chlorine atoms (~27:27:9:1, or simplified ~9:9:3:0.33). The two most intense peaks are roughly equal, the third is about a third of their intensity, and the fourth is very small. This is strong evidence that the molecule contains **three chlorine atoms**.\n7.  The peak at m/z 260 corresponds to the molecular ion containing only the lightest isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl). Therefore, the nominal molecular weight of the compound is **260 u**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\n1.  We know the molecule contains 3 Cl atoms. The mass of 3 x ³⁵Cl is 105 u.\n2.  The remaining mass is 260 - 105 = 155 u. This mass must be accounted for by carbon, hydrogen, and possibly oxygen atoms (as nitrogen is unlikely, given the even molecular weight).\n3.  Let's test possible formulas for the CₓHᵧO₂ part:\n    *   **Without Oxygen (CₓHᵧ):** The remaining mass is 155. Using the \"Rule of 13,\" 155 / 13 = 11 with a remainder of 12. This suggests a base formula of C₁₁H₁₁+₁₂ = C₁₁H₂₃. The full molecular formula would be C₁₁H₂₃Cl₃. The degree of unsaturation for this formula is negative, which is impossible. Trying other C/H combinations also fails to produce a valid formula.\n    *   **With Oxygen (CₓHᵧO₂):** Let's assume two oxygen atoms (mass = 32 u), a common feature in esters. The remaining mass is 155 - 32 = 123 u. Using the \"Rule of 13\" for CₓHᵧ: 123 / 13 = 9 with a remainder of 6. This suggests a base formula of C₉H₉+₆ = C₉H₁₅.\n4.  This gives a plausible molecular formula of **C₉H₁₅O₂Cl₃**.\n5.  Let's check the molecular weight: (9 × 12) + (15 × 1) + (2 × 16) + (3 × 35) = 108 + 15 + 32 + 105 = 260. This matches perfectly.\n6.  The degree of unsaturation is: 9 - (15/2) - (3/2) + 1 = 9 - 9 + 1 = 1. This is consistent with a single double bond, such as a carbonyl group (C=O) in an ester or acid.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Fragmentation to Determine the Structure**\n\nThe molecular formula C₉H₁₅O₂Cl₃ and the DoU=1 strongly suggest an ester. A likely candidate is an ester formed from trichloroethanoic acid (CCl₃COOH) and a heptyl alcohol (C₇H₁₅OH). This would be a **heptyl trichloroethanoate**. Let's see if the fragmentation pattern supports this structure: CCl₃-CO-O-C₇H₁₅.\n\n1.  **Base Peak (m/z 225, I=100%):** This corresponds to a loss of 35 u from the molecular ion (260 - 225 = 35). This is the loss of a single chlorine atom (•Cl). The fragment is [M - Cl]⁺, or [C₉H₁₅O₂Cl₂]⁺. For this to be the most abundant fragment, the resulting cation must be particularly stable. While unusual, it's a possible fragmentation pathway.\n2.  **Peak at m/z 118 (I=43.5%):** This is a very significant peak. It corresponds to the mass of chloroform (HCCl₃). Its formation can be explained by a rearrangement where a hydrogen atom from the heptyl chain is transferred to the CCl₃ group, followed by cleavage to form the [HCCl₃]⁺• ion. The isotope peaks at m/z 120 (I=29.6%) and 122 (I=4.88%) support the presence of a 3-chlorine fragment.\n3.  **Peak at m/z 143 (I=27.8%):** This corresponds to a loss of 117 u from the molecular ion (260 - 143 = 117). The mass 117 u matches the trichloromethyl radical (•CCl₃). The resulting fragment ion is [C₇H₁₅OCO]⁺. Its mass is (7×12+15×1) + 12 + (2×16) = 99 + 12 + 32 = 143. This is a perfect match and provides very strong evidence for the proposed ester structure.\n4.  **Peak at m/z 141 (I=28.1%):** This peak is likely formed by the loss of H₂ from the m/z 143 fragment ([C₇H₁₅OCO - H₂]⁺), a common subsequent fragmentation for ions containing alkyl chains.\n5.  **Alkyl Fragments:** The presence of smaller peaks like m/z 71 (I=10.6%), corresponding to [C₅H₁₁]⁺, is consistent with the fragmentation of a C₇ alkyl chain.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll the major fragments in the mass spectrum are consistent with the structure of heptyl trichloroethanoate. The question asks for the systematic IUPAC name.\n*   The acid is trichloroethanoic acid (the systematic name for trichloroacetic acid).\n*   The alcohol is heptanol.\n*   The ester is named as an alkyl alkanoate.\n\nTherefore, the systematic IUPAC name of the compound is **heptyl trichloroethanoate**.\n\n<<<heptyl trichloroethanoate>>>"
