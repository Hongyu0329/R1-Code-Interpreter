    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Examine the image for clues:** The primary goal is to identify the artist. The most direct way to do this is to find a signature on the painting.\n2.  **Locate the signature:** By carefully scanning the painting, particularly the corners, a signature can be found in the bottom right. The provided cropped images, especially the last one, offer a clear view of this area.\n3.  **Decipher the signature:** The signature reads \"marquet\". Below the signature, there is additional text which appears to be \"Port-Cros '38\". This indicates the location (Port-Cros, an island off the French coast) and the year the painting was made (1938).\n4.  **Identify the artist:** The signature \"marquet\" corresponds to the well-known French painter Albert Marquet.\n5.  **Verify the artist's identity:** A search for \"Albert Marquet\" confirms he was a Fauvist painter known for his landscapes and waterscapes. His style, particularly his use of watercolor and his depiction of light on water, is consistent with the provided image. Furthermore, historical records show that he did paint in Port-Cros. Therefore, the artist is Albert Marquet.\n6.  **State the full name:** The question asks for the full name of the artist, which is Albert Marquet.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   The signature is not perfectly legible at first glance, but the context and style of the painting help in its identification.\n*   The additional text (\"Port-Cros '38\") is a crucial piece of information that helps confirm the artist and the specific work.\n*   The question asks for the \"full name\", so providing just the last name \"Marquet\" would be incomplete.\n\n<<<Albert Marquet>>>"
