    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the century of the medallion.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The image displays a medallion or plaque with a suspension loop at the top. It is made of a reflective material, likely a precious metal such as gold, silver, or electrum.\n2.  **Iconographic Analysis:** The central image on the medallion is a pair of confronted busts, one male and one female.\n    *   The bust on the left (male) has a distinct, highly stylized hairstyle with crescent-shaped locks and what appear to be curls or a specific type of knot on the side. His eye is large and staring.\n    *   The bust on the right (female) is less clear but also features a stylized coiffure and large eyes.\n    *   Both figures wear draped garments.\n3.  **Stylistic Analysis:** The style is not classical Greco-Roman. The features are not naturalistic but are instead abstract and expressive. This includes:\n    *   **Large, prominent eyes:** A common feature in Late Antique and early medieval art.\n    *   **Stylized, patterned hair:** The hair is rendered as a decorative pattern rather than a realistic depiction of hair texture.\n    *   **Flattened perspective and high relief:** The figures are in high relief but lack the depth and anatomical correctness of classical sculpture.\n    *   This combination of stylistic elements points away from the High Roman Empire and towards the art of the Late Roman Empire and the subsequent Migration Period (sometimes called the \"Barbarian\" art).\n4.  **Artifact Recognition:** Through art historical knowledge and image recognition, this specific object can be identified as the **Plaque from Kerch**.\n    *   It was found in a tomb in Kerch (ancient Panticapaeum) in Crimea.\n    *   It is made of electrum (an alloy of gold and silver).\n    *   It is considered a masterpiece of Migration Period art, often associated with the Goths who inhabited the region.\n5.  **Dating:** The style of the Kerch Plaque, along with the archaeological context of its discovery, allows experts to date it with a high degree of confidence. It is a key artifact for understanding the art of the Germanic peoples on the borders of the Roman Empire during the period of great migrations. Archaeologists and art historians consistently place its creation in the **4th century A.D.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the stylistic analysis and the identification of the object as the famous Kerch Plaque, the medallion is ascribed to the Migration Period.\n\n<<<4th century A.D.>>>"
