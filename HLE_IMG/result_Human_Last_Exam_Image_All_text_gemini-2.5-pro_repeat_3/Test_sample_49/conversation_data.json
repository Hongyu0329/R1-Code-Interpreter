    "An analysis of the problem to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$ is performed as follows.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Goal**\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$. This node is connected to ground via a capacitor $C$. The rest of the circuit is a resistive ladder network. This configuration forms a first-order low-pass RC filter. The cutoff frequency is the frequency at which the magnitude of the filter's transfer function drops to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of its DC value.\n\n**2. Formulating the Problem**\nFor a simple RC filter, the angular cutoff frequency, $\\omega_c$, is given by the formula:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C}$\nwhere $R_{th}$ is the Thevenin equivalent resistance of the circuit \"seen\" by the capacitor $C$. The cutoff frequency in Hertz, $f_c$, is then $f_c = \\omega_c / (2\\pi)$.\nThe main task is to calculate this Thevenin resistance, $R_{th}$.\n\n**3. Calculating the Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$ at node $a_0$, we perform the following steps:\n*   Remove the capacitor $C$.\n*   Deactivate all independent sources. The input `IN` at node $c_0$ is treated as a voltage source, so we set its voltage to zero by connecting node $c_0$ to ground.\n*   Calculate the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground. Let's call node $a_0$ as $d_0$ for systematic labeling. We need to find $R_{th} = R_{d0, gnd}$.\n\n**4. Analyzing the Infinite Ladder Network**\nThe circuit is an infinite ladder. We can analyze it by setting up recurrence relations for the node voltages. Let $v_{cn}$ and $v_{dn}$ be the voltage at nodes $c_n$ and $d_n$ respectively. We assume a test voltage $V_t$ is applied at node $a_0=d_0$, so $v_{d0}=V_t$. We also have $v_{c0}=0$ since the input is grounded.\n\nBy applying Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at nodes $c_n$ and $d_n$ for $n \\ge 1$, we get a system of linear difference equations:\n*   **KCL at node $c_n$**: The sum of currents leaving the node is zero.\n    $\\frac{v_{cn} - v_{c(n-1)}}{r} + \\frac{v_{cn} - v_{c(n+1)}}{r} + \\frac{v_{cn} - v_{dn}}{r} = 0$\n    $v_{c(n-1)} + v_{c(n+1)} + v_{dn} - 3v_{cn} = 0$  (Eq. 1)\n\n*   **KCL at node $d_n$**:\n    $\\frac{v_{dn} - v_{d(n-1)}}{r} + \\frac{v_{dn} - v_{d(n+1)}}{r} + \\frac{v_{dn} - v_{cn}}{r} = 0$\n    $v_{d(n-1)} + v_{d(n+1)} + v_{cn} - 3v_{dn} = 0$  (Eq. 2)\n\nWe look for solutions of the form $v_{cn} = A\\lambda^n$ and $v_{dn} = B\\lambda^n$. Substituting these into the equations leads to a characteristic equation for $\\lambda$. A more direct approach is to analyze the common-mode ($S_n = v_{cn}+v_{dn}$) and differential-mode ($D_n = v_{cn}-v_{dn}$) voltages.\n*   Adding (Eq. 1) and (Eq. 2) gives: $S_{n+1} - 2S_n + S_{n-1} = 0$.\n*   Subtracting (Eq. 2) from (Eq. 1) gives: $D_{n+1} - 4D_n + D_{n-1} = 0$.\n\nThe characteristic equations are:\n*   For $S_n$: $\\lambda^2 - 2\\lambda + 1 = 0 \\implies (\\lambda-1)^2 = 0 \\implies \\lambda=1$ (repeated root).\n*   For $D_n$: $\\lambda^2 - 4\\lambda + 1 = 0 \\implies \\lambda = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nFor the voltages to remain finite as $n \\to \\infty$, we must select the decaying modes.\n*   For $S_n$, the solution is $S_n = A' + B'n$. For boundedness, $B'=0$, so $S_n$ must be a constant, $S_n = K_S$.\n*   For $D_n$, we must choose the root $|\\lambda| < 1$, which is $\\lambda_1 = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$. So $D_n = K_D (2-\\sqrt{3})^n$.\n\nThe general solutions for the node voltages are:\n$v_{cn} = \\frac{S_n + D_n}{2} = \\frac{K_S}{2} + \\frac{K_D}{2} (2-\\sqrt{3})^n$\n$v_{dn} = \\frac{S_n - D_n}{2} = \\frac{K_S}{2} - \\frac{K_D}{2} (2-\\sqrt{3})^n$\n\n**5. Applying Boundary Conditions**\nWe use the boundary conditions at $n=0$ to find the constants $K_S$ and $K_D$.\n*   $v_{c0} = 0$: $\\frac{K_S}{2} + \\frac{K_D}{2} (2-\\sqrt{3})^0 = 0 \\implies K_S + K_D = 0 \\implies K_S = -K_D$.\n*   $v_{d0} = V_t$: $\\frac{K_S}{2} - \\frac{K_D}{2} (2-\\sqrt{3})^0 = V_t \\implies K_S - K_D = 2V_t$.\n\nSolving this system:\n$(-K_D) - K_D = 2V_t \\implies -2K_D = 2V_t \\implies K_D = -V_t$.\n$K_S = -K_D = V_t$.\n\nSo, the voltage at any node $d_n$ is:\n$v_{dn} = \\frac{V_t}{2} - \\frac{-V_t}{2} (2-\\sqrt{3})^n = \\frac{V_t}{2} (1 + (2-\\sqrt{3})^n)$.\n\n**6. Calculating the Thevenin Resistance**\nThe current $I_t$ drawn from the test source at $a_0 = d_0$ is the current flowing into the resistor between $d_0$ and $d_1$.\n$I_t = \\frac{v_{d0} - v_{d1}}{r}$\nWe have $v_{d0} = V_t$.\n$v_{d1} = \\frac{V_t}{2} (1 + (2-\\sqrt{3})^1) = \\frac{V_t}{2} (1 + 2 - \\sqrt{3}) = \\frac{V_t}{2} (3 - \\sqrt{3})$.\n\n$I_t = \\frac{V_t - \\frac{V_t}{2} (3 - \\sqrt{3})}{r} = \\frac{V_t}{r} \\left(1 - \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{V_t}{r} \\left(\\frac{2 - 3 + \\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{V_t}{r} \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{2}$.\n\nThe Thevenin resistance is $R_{th} = \\frac{V_t}{I_t}$.\n$R_{th} = \\frac{r}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{2}} = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3} - 1}$.\nTo simplify, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate $(\\sqrt{3} + 1)$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\\sqrt{3} - 1)(\\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$.\n\n**7. Determining the Cutoff Frequency**\nNow we can find the cutoff frequency. Using the angular frequency $\\omega_c$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C} = \\frac{1}{r(1 + \\sqrt{3})C}$.\n\nThe cutoff frequency in Hertz is:\n$f_c = \\frac{\\omega_c}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r(1 + \\sqrt{3})C}$.\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency expressed in terms of $r$ and $C$. The expression for the angular frequency $\\omega_c$ is typically sufficient and cleaner.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n*   The circuit is an **infinite ladder**, which is a key feature allowing the use of recurrence relations and assuming a repeating structure.\n*   The **Thevenin equivalent resistance** is the correct parameter to find for determining the cutoff frequency of the RC filter.\n*   When calculating $R_{th}$, the input voltage source must be **deactivated** (shorted to ground).\n*   The problem can be solved by setting up and solving a system of **linear difference equations** for the node voltages.\n*   The physical constraint that voltages must be **bounded at infinity** is crucial for selecting the correct mathematical solutions (the decaying exponential modes).\n*   The boundary conditions are defined at $n=0$: `IN` port ($c_0$) is grounded, and a test voltage is applied at the output port ($a_0 = d_0$).\n*   The final calculation of resistance involves careful algebraic manipulation, including rationalizing the denominator.\n*   The term \"cutoff frequency\" can refer to either angular frequency $\\omega_c$ (in rad/s) or cyclical frequency $f_c$ (in Hz). Both are related by a factor of $2\\pi$. The derived expression is valid for both.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe Thevenin resistance seen by the capacitor at node $a_0$ is $R_{th} = r(1+\\sqrt{3})$.\nThe cutoff angular frequency $\\omega_c$ is given by $\\omega_c = 1/(R_{th}C)$.\nTherefore, the cutoff frequency is $\\frac{1}{(1+\\sqrt{3})rC}$.\n\n<<<1/((1+sqrt(3))*r*C)>>>"
