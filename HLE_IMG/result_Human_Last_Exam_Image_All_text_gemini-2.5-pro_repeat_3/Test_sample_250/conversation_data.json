    "This is a step-by-step analysis to identify the title and composer of the jazz standard from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Key and Time Signature**\n*   The key signature has four flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭). This indicates the key of A♭ major or its relative minor, F minor.\n*   The first chord shown is F- (F minor), and the piece ends on an F chord, strongly suggesting the key is **F minor**.\n*   The time signature is 4/4, which is common time in jazz.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Melody**\n*   The melody in the first full measure consists of the notes C, A♭, and G. In the key of F minor, these are the 5th, minor 3rd, and 2nd degrees of the scale.\n*   The melody in the second measure consists of the notes F, E♭, and D♭. These are the tonic (1st), minor 7th, and minor 6th degrees.\n*   This descending melodic phrase (C-A♭-G | F-E♭-D♭) is very distinctive and a strong clue for identifying the tune.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Chord Progression**\n*   The chord progression begins: F- | E-7♭5 | E♭-6 | D♭maj7 G7 | C7 ...\n*   This progression features a chromatic descending bass line in the first three measures (F -> E -> E♭), which is a characteristic harmonic device. While not the most common \"Real Book\" version of the chords for this tune, it is a known reharmonization that fits the melody perfectly.\n*   The bridge section (starting with D-7♭5) features a series of ii-V progressions and dominant chords (D-7♭5 -> G7, C7 -> F7, B♭-7 -> E♭7) that modulate before returning to the home key. This type of bridge structure is very common in jazz standards from the hard bop era.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Standard**\n*   The combination of the specific melodic phrase in the first few bars, the key of F minor, and the AABA structure with a modulating bridge strongly points to a single famous jazz standard.\n*   The tune is **\"Nica's Dream\"**. The melody is a direct match to the original recording.\n*   The composer of \"Nica's Dream\" is the acclaimed jazz pianist and composer **Horace Silver**. It was first recorded by the Horace Silver Quintet in 1956.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the melodic, harmonic, and structural analysis of the provided lead sheet, the jazz standard is \"Nica's Dream\" composed by Horace Silver.\n\n<<<Title: Nica's Dream, Composer: Horace Silver>>>"
