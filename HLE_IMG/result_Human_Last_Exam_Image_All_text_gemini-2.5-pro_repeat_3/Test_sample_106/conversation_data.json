    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the substituents at the indicated positions.\n\n**1. Reaction Identification**\nThe reaction shown is the acid-catalyzed dehydration of a polycyclic alcohol. The starting material is a triterpenoid alcohol, and it is treated with catalytic hydrochloric acid (HCl) at a high temperature (110 °C). These conditions favor the formation of a carbocation intermediate, which can undergo rearrangements before elimination occurs to form the final alkene product. The question explicitly mentions that the rearrangement involves a series of [1,2] shifts, which points to a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, a characteristic reaction of such terpene systems.\n\n**2. Mechanism Initiation: Carbocation Formation**\n*   **Step A:** The hydroxyl (-OH) group on the starting material is a poor leaving group. The acid catalyst (H⁺ from HCl) protonates the oxygen atom of the -OH group to form a protonated alcohol (-OH₂⁺).\n*   **Step B:** The -OH₂⁺ group is an excellent leaving group. It departs as a water molecule (H₂O), leaving behind a positive charge on the carbon it was attached to (C3). This creates a secondary carbocation at C3.\n\n**3. The Rearrangement Cascade: A Series of [1,2] Shifts**\nSecondary carbocations are relatively unstable and will rearrange if a more stable carbocation (e.g., a tertiary carbocation) can be formed. In this complex ring system, the initial carbocation triggers a cascade of [1,2] shifts (where a group, either a hydride (H⁻) or a methide (CH₃⁻), moves from an adjacent carbon to the carbocation center). This cascade, known as the \"backbone rearrangement,\" is driven by both the formation of more stable carbocations and the relief of steric strain in the fused ring system. The shifts generally occur in an *anti-periplanar* fashion.\n\nLet's track the movement of the positive charge and the migrating groups. We will use standard triterpenoid numbering for the carbon skeleton.\n\n*   **Initial State:** Carbocation at C3 (secondary).\n*   **Shift 1:** A methyl group (CH₃) from the adjacent C4 shifts to C3. This moves the positive charge to C4, forming a more stable tertiary carbocation. One of the two methyls at C4 has now moved to C3.\n*   **Shift 2:** A hydrogen atom (H) from C5 shifts to the carbocation at C4. The positive charge moves to C5 (tertiary).\n*   **Shift 3:** The methyl group (CH₃) from C10 shifts to the carbocation at C5. The positive charge moves to C10 (tertiary).\n*   **Shift 4:** A hydrogen atom (H) from C9 shifts to the carbocation at C10. The positive charge moves to C9 (tertiary).\n*   **Shift 5:** A hydrogen atom (H) from C8 shifts to the carbocation at C9. The positive charge moves to C8 (tertiary).\n*   **Shift 6:** The methyl group (CH₃) from C14 shifts to the carbocation at C8. The positive charge moves to C14 (tertiary).\n*   **Shift 7:** A hydrogen atom (H) from C13 shifts to the carbocation at C14. The positive charge moves to C13 (tertiary).\n\n**4. Termination: Elimination to Form the Alkene**\nThe cascade of rearrangements stops at the carbocation at C13. To form the final stable product, a proton is eliminated from an adjacent carbon. The product structure shows a double bond between C13 and C18. This is formed by the removal of a proton (H⁺) from C18.\n\n**5. Determining the Substituents in the Final Product**\nNow we can determine what substituent (H or CH₃) is at each of the numbered positions in the final product by tracking where the original groups have moved.\n\n*   **Position 1 (at C4):** Originally, C4 had two methyl groups. One migrated to C3. A hydrogen from C5 migrated to C4. Therefore, C4 in the product has one methyl group and one hydrogen. The label '1' points to this remaining methyl group.\n    *   **1 = CH₃**\n*   **Position 2 (at C10):** Originally, C10 had a methyl group. This methyl group migrated to C5. A hydrogen from C9 migrated to C10. Therefore, the substituent at C10 is now a hydrogen.\n    *   **2 = H**\n*   **Position 3 (at C9):** Originally, C9 had a hydrogen atom. This hydrogen migrated to C10. A hydrogen from C8 migrated to C9. Therefore, the substituent at C9 is still a hydrogen.\n    *   **3 = H**\n*   **Position 4 (at C8):** Originally, C8 had a hydrogen atom. This hydrogen migrated to C9. A methyl group from C14 migrated to C8. Therefore, the substituent at C8 is now a methyl group.\n    *   **4 = CH₃**\n*   **Position 5 (at C14):** Originally, C14 had a methyl group. This methyl group migrated to C8. A hydrogen from C13 migrated to C14. Therefore, the substituent at C14 is now a hydrogen.\n    *   **5 = H**\n\n**Summary of Final Substituents:**\n*   1 = CH₃\n*   2 = H\n*   3 = H\n*   4 = CH₃\n*   5 = H\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
