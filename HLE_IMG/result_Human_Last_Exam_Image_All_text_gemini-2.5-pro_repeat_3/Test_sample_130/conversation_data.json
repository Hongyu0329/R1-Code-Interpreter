    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Image**\nThe image provided is a line emission spectrum. This type of spectrum is generated when the electrons of an element are excited to higher energy levels and then fall back to lower levels, emitting photons of light at specific, discrete wavelengths. Each element has a unique emission spectrum that acts as its \"fingerprint.\" The colors correspond to the wavelength of the emitted light, with blue/violet having shorter wavelengths and red having longer wavelengths.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Key Features of the Spectrum**\nWe need to carefully observe the pattern of the bright lines: their colors, positions, and relative intensities.\n*   **Violet/Blue Region (left side):** There are several lines. One prominent line is visible in the blue-violet area. There are also fainter lines in the deep violet.\n*   **Cyan/Green Region (middle-left):** There are several lines in the blue-green (cyan) and green part of the spectrum.\n*   **Prominent Green Line:** There is a single, very bright, and distinct green line that stands out more than any other line in this region. This is a very strong clue.\n*   **Yellow-Orange Region:** There is a prominent bright line in the yellow-orange part of the spectrum. It appears as a single thick line, but in some elements, this can be a \"doublet\" â€“ two lines very close together that may blur into one at lower resolutions.\n*   **Red Region (right side):** There are a few distinct lines in the red portion of the spectrum.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Observed Spectrum with Known Elemental Spectra**\nNow, we compare this observed pattern with the characteristic spectra of common elements.\n\n*   **Hydrogen:** The visible spectrum of hydrogen (the Balmer series) is very simple, consisting of four main lines: a red line (H-alpha), a cyan line (H-beta), a blue-violet line (H-gamma), and a violet line (H-delta). The spectrum in the image is far more complex than this.\n*   **Helium:** Helium has a number of bright lines, including a prominent yellow line and a strong red line, but the overall pattern and spacing of lines, especially in the blue and green regions, do not match the image.\n*   **Neon:** Neon is famous for its bright red-orange glow. Its spectrum is heavily dominated by a large number of lines in the red and orange part of the spectrum. The given spectrum has strong lines across the entire visible range, not just in the red.\n*   **Sodium:** Sodium is characterized by a very intense, dominant yellow doublet (two lines extremely close together). While the spectrum shown has a yellow line, it also has many other strong lines in the blue, green, and red, which is not characteristic of sodium.\n*   **Mercury (Hg):** The emission spectrum of mercury is well-known and has several key features that match the image perfectly:\n    *   A strong violet line at ~404.7 nm and a strong blue-violet line at ~435.8 nm. This matches the prominent lines on the left.\n    *   A very strong, dominant green line at ~546.1 nm. This matches the most prominent green line in the image.\n    *   A bright yellow doublet at ~577 nm and ~579 nm. At the resolution of the image, these appear as a single bright yellow-orange line, which is consistent with what we see.\n    *   Several other lines in the red, blue, and cyan regions, which are also present in the image.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nThe pattern of lines in the image, particularly the combination of a strong blue-violet line, a dominant, sharp green line, and a bright yellow-orange line, is the unique and unmistakable fingerprint of the element Mercury (Hg).\n\n<<<Mercury>>>"
