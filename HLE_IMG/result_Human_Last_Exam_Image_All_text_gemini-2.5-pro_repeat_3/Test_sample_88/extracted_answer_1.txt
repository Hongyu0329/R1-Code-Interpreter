**Product A (C14H20N2O3):** The primary [3+2] cycloadduct formed from the reaction of methyl propiolate with the azomethine ylide derived from decarboxylation of product C. Its structure is a hexahydropyrrolizine core substituted with a methyl carboxylate group and an N-acetyl-dihydropyrrolyl group.

**Product B (C12H14N2O3):** The product of a decarboxylative cycloaddition between the un-acetylated starting material and methyl propiolate, which has subsequently undergone full aromatization of both the cycloadduct core and the substituent ring, and oxidation to an N-oxide.

**Product C (C11H16N2O3):** The N-acetylated enamine tautomer of the starting material, (S)-1-(1-acetyl-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid.
