**Product A** is acetamide.
**Product B** is N-acetyl-2-pyrrolidone.
**Product C** is N-acetyl-2-pyrrolidone.

Here are the structures:

**A: Acetamide**
```
      O
     //
CH₃-C-NH₂
```

**B & C: N-acetyl-2-pyrrolidone**
```
      O=C-CH₃
      |
  O=C-N
   |   \
  CH₂--CH₂
   \  /
    CH₂
```
The structures can be visualized as:
A: A two-carbon chain with a carbonyl group and an amino group on one carbon, and a methyl group on the other.
B & C: A five-membered ring containing one nitrogen atom and a carbonyl group adjacent to it (a lactam). The nitrogen atom is further substituted with an acetyl group (C(=O)CH₃).
