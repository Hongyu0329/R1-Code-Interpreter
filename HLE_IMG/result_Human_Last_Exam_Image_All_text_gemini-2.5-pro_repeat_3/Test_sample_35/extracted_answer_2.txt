The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **V domain** of the RAGE receptor, as depicted by the direct interaction in the diagram.

S100B could be used as a **prognostic marker**. Here is the explanation:
*   **Adjunct vs. Prognostic Role:** An adjunct marker aids in diagnosis but lacks specificity, while a prognostic marker predicts the future course or outcome of a disease.
*   **Lack of Specificity:** The text states S100B is over-expressed in multiple diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, MS, cardiovascular disease). This lack of specificity means it can only serve as an **adjunct marker** for diagnosis, not a standalone one.
*   **Prognostic Value:** The diagram clearly shows that S100B binding to RAGE activates pathways (NFÎºB, JNK) that directly cause neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Because the concentration of S100B is directly linked to the severity of these pathological processes, its level can be used to predict the progression and aggressiveness of the neurological disorder. A higher level of S100B would indicate a more active disease state and thus a poorer prognosis. Therefore, it serves as a valuable prognostic marker.
