    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the core structure of the molecule.**\n    The molecule is a complex polycyclic compound. It contains four fused rings and two nitrogen atoms. This tetracyclic diamine framework is characteristic of a class of alkaloids known as quinolizidine alkaloids, specifically the sparteine type. The core can be viewed as two quinolizidine units (bicyclic systems with a nitrogen at the bridgehead) fused together.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the functional groups.**\n    The most prominent functional group, apart from the tertiary amine and the saturated rings, is the carbonyl group (C=O). This carbonyl group is adjacent to a nitrogen atom within a six-membered ring, forming an amide functional group within a cyclic structure. This specific type of functional group is called a lactam (specifically, a Î´-lactam, as it is in a six-membered ring).\n\n*   **Step 3: Consider the parent compound and the modification.**\n    The underlying tetracyclic framework without the carbonyl group is known as sparteine. The given molecule is therefore an oxo-derivative of sparteine. The presence of the lactam functionality at this specific position (C-2 in standard nomenclature) gives the compound its common name.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the stereochemistry.**\n    The drawing uses wedges and dashes to indicate the specific three-dimensional arrangement of the atoms. There are several chiral centers at the ring junctions. This particular stereoisomer, which is the most common natural form, is crucial for its identity. The stereochemistry shown corresponds to (+)-lupanine.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the name.**\n    Based on the tetracyclic sparteine skeleton, the presence of a lactam at the C-2 position, and the specific stereochemistry shown, the compound is identified as Lupanine. Lupanine is a well-known alkaloid found in the seeds of plants from the *Lupinus* genus (lupins), hence it's also classified as a lupin alkaloid.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
