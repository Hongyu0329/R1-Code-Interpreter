    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and image to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual information in the image.**\n*   The image contains two plots, both representing a sound over time (time progresses from left to right).\n*   The top plot is a spectrogram. It shows the frequency content of the sound over time. We see a strong horizontal line, indicating a pure tone at a constant frequency. In the middle, this line is interrupted and replaced by a vertical smudge, which represents a burst of sound across a wide range of frequencies (i.e., noise).\n*   The bottom plot is the corresponding waveform. It starts as a clean, regular sine wave (representing the pure tone). In the middle, it becomes a complex, irregular waveform (representing the noise). After the noise, it returns to being a clean sine wave.\n*   Crucially, the physical stimulus is: TONE -> NOISE -> TONE. There is no tone present *during* the noise.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the text of the question.**\nThe question provides several key clues to identify the phenomenon:\n*   It is an **\"illusion\"**. This means that what is perceived is different from the physical reality of the stimulus.\n*   It is compared to the **\"Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity\"**. The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where the brain interprets an ambiguous 2D drawing in one of two possible 3D ways, and can switch between these interpretations. This suggests the auditory phenomenon also involves the brain interpreting an ambiguous stimulus and \"choosing\" a more plausible reality.\n*   It reveals a **\"surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\"**. This indicates that the illusion is not just a laboratory curiosity but something that our perceptual system does automatically and frequently in everyday life.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the visual and textual information.**\n*   When a person listens to the sound represented in the image (tone -> noise -> tone), the typical perception is that the tone continues uninterrupted *behind* the noise. The brain \"fills in\" the auditory gap. This is the illusion: a continuous tone is perceived where there is physically none.\n*   This \"filling in\" is the brain's way of resolving ambiguity. The stimulus could be a tone that stops, is replaced by noise, and then starts again. Or, it could be a continuous tone that is temporarily masked by a louder noise. The brain, based on real-world experience, deems the second scenario far more probable and thus constructs that perception. This is analogous to the Necker Cube, where the brain constructs a plausible 3D shape from a 2D drawing.\n*   The ability to perceptually restore obscured sounds is extremely common and vital. A prime example is understanding speech in a noisy environment (e.g., a party or a busy street). If a word is partially obscured by a cough or a door slam, we usually don't even notice the interruption and perceive the word as whole. This is the \"common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\" mentioned.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the name of the phenomenon.**\n*   The general principle of perceiving an interrupted sound as continuous is called the **Auditory Continuity Illusion** or **perceptual restoration of sound**.\n*   The most famous and extensively studied example of this principle, specifically involving the restoration of missing speech sounds (phonemes), is known as the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**. It was first demonstrated by Richard Warren in 1970.\n*   Although the image uses a simple tone (not a phoneme), the question's emphasis on a \"common... perceptual ability\" strongly points to the real-world significance of this illusion, which is best exemplified by the Phonemic Restoration Effect in speech perception. Educational materials often use the simpler tone-and-noise diagram to illustrate the fundamental mechanism behind phonemic restoration. Therefore, the Phonemic Restoration Effect is the most likely intended answer as it captures the essence and importance of the phenomenon described.\n\n<<<Phonemic Restoration Effect>>>"
