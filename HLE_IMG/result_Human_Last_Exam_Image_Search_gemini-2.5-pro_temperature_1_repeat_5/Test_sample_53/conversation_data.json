    "The figure leaving the chariot is a man who has been run over. The scene depicted on this Apulian red-figure pelike is a representation of the death of the Thracian king Diomedes.\n\nThis vase, attributed to the Diomedes Painter, dates to approximately 410-400 B.C. and is housed in the National Archaeological Museum of Naples. The scene illustrates the eighth labor of Herakles.\n\nIn the myth, Herakles was tasked with capturing the four man-eating mares of King Diomedes. After defeating the king, Herakles fed his body to his own horses. The vase shows the moment Diomedes is being trampled by the chariot pulled by his mares. The charioteer in the Phrygian cap is one of Diomedes's stable hands, and a winged Nike flies above, symbolizing Herakles's victory.\n\n<<<A man being run over by the chariot.>>>"
