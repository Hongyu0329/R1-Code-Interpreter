    "Based on the detailed analysis of the provided spectra, the compound is identified as **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n### **Analysis Breakdown**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak at m/z 135 suggests a molecular weight of 135 g/mol. Applying the Nitrogen Rule (an odd molecular weight indicates an odd number of nitrogen atoms), the molecular formula was determined to be **C₉H₁₃N**. This formula corresponds to a molecular weight of 135.21 g/mol and has a degree of unsaturation of 4, consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The IR spectrum shows key absorptions:\n    *   Above 3000 cm⁻¹: C-H stretching for the aromatic ring.\n    *   Below 3000 cm⁻¹: C-H stretching for aliphatic (sp³) carbons.\n    *   ~3300-3400 cm⁻¹: A broad peak characteristic of an N-H stretch from a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   ~1600 cm⁻¹: N-H bending, also supporting a primary amine.\n    *   ~1450-1500 cm⁻¹: C=C stretching from the aromatic ring.\n    *   ~700 and 750 cm⁻¹: Strong bands indicating a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n\n3.  **¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The spectrum displays 7 unique carbon signals. Four are in the aromatic region (δ 126-146 ppm) and three are in the aliphatic region (δ 19.2, 43.5, 49.6 ppm).\n    *   DEPT-135 data, indicating five positive signals (CH or CH₃) and one negative signal (CH₂), combined with the ¹³C spectrum, establishes the presence of:\n        *   One methyl group (CH₃)\n        *   One methylene group (CH₂)\n        *   One methine group (CH)\n        *   Three aromatic methine groups (CH)\n        *   One quaternary aromatic carbon\n    *   This confirms a side chain composed of a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group.\n\n4.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **δ 7.2-7.4 ppm (5H, multiplet):** Protons of a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **δ ~2.8 ppm (1H, multiplet):** A methine (CH) proton adjacent to the -CH₂ and -CH₃ groups.\n    *   **δ ~2.6 ppm (2H, multiplet):** The benzylic methylene (CH₂) protons.\n    *   **δ ~1.2 ppm (3H, doublet):** A methyl (CH₃) group adjacent to a single proton (the CH group).\n    *   The presence of two additional protons (to match the C₉H₁₃N formula) is accounted for by the primary amine group (-NH₂), whose protons often appear as a broad signal or exchange with the solvent.\n\n5.  **HSQC Spectroscopy:** This 2D spectrum correlates the proton signals with their directly attached carbon atoms, confirming the assignments made from the 1D NMR spectra:\n    *   The doublet at 1.2 ppm is connected to the CH₃ carbon at 19.2 ppm.\n    *   The multiplet at 2.6 ppm is connected to the CH₂ carbon at 43.5 ppm.\n    *   The multiplet at 2.8 ppm is connected to the CH carbon at 49.6 ppm.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe collective data unambiguously points to the structure of 1-phenylpropan-2-amine, which is also commonly known as amphetamine. The chemical shifts and splitting patterns from the provided spectra are in excellent agreement with published reference data for this compound.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
