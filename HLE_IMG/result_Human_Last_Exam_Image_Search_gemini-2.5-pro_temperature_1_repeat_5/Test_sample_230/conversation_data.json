    "The title of the 19th-century painting is **\"A windmill burning, by night\"** by the Dutch artist Hendrik Gerrit ten Cate (1803-1856).\n\nThis artwork, an oil on panel, is a notable example of the painter's work, which often featured cityscapes and landscapes with dramatic lighting, such as moonlight or fire. The painting depicts a windmill engulfed in flames against a dark, stormy sky, a theme that captures the Romantic fascination with dramatic and atmospheric scenes prevalent in the 19th century. While some sources may also refer to it simply as \"The fire\" or \"Burning mill,\" \"A windmill burning, by night\" is a documented title for this specific piece.\n\n<<<A windmill burning, by night>>>"
