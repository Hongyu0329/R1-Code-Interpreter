    "This protein is known as **Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 S**, often abbreviated as **UBE2S**. The image corresponds to the three-dimensional structure of the human version of this enzyme.\n\nUBE2S is a key component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is crucial for protein degradation and cellular regulation. Specifically, it functions as an E2 enzyme, accepting ubiquitin from an E1 activating enzyme and transferring it to target proteins with the help of an E3 ligase. This process marks proteins for degradation.\n\nThis enzyme plays a significant role in cell cycle control, particularly during mitosis. It is an essential factor for the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), a major cell cycle-regulated ubiquitin ligase. UBE2S helps in elongating specific 'Lys-11'-linked polyubiquitin chains on APC/C substrates, which promotes their degradation and allows the cell to exit mitosis.\n\nDue to its role in cell proliferation, overexpression of UBE2S has been linked to the progression of several types of cancer, including breast, lung, and liver cancers, making it a subject of interest for cancer therapy research. The structure shown in the image is often referenced by its Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID, 2F4W.\n\n<<<Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 S>>>"
