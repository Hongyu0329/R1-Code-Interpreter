    "The organisms in the photo consist of a primary fungus and another organism growing on top of it.\n\nThe larger, shelf-like fungus is a type of polypore, most likely **Turkey Tail** (*Trametes versicolor*) or a closely related species. This is a very common wood-decaying fungus found on dead logs and stumps.\n\nThe tiny, black, hair-like organisms growing on the surface of the Turkey Tail are a type of parasitic or saprobic fungus, often referred to as a **pin mold**. One common example that parasitizes mushrooms is **Bonnet Mold** (*Spinellus fusiger*). This fungus appears as erect, pale brownish-yellow to blackish sporangiophores (stalks) on the caps of its host mushroom.\n\nAnother possibility, though less commonly documented on other fungi, is a species like **Candlesnuff Fungus** (*Xylaria hypoxylon*), which has erect, stick-like fruiting bodies that are black at the base and have a powdery white tip. However, given the parasitic nature and appearance in the photo, a pin mold like *Spinellus fusiger* is a more probable identification for the black organism.\n\n<<<Spinellus fusiger (Bonnet Mold)>>>"
