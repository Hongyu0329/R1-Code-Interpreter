    "An accurate Roman numeral for the circled notes in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397, is **vii°7/V**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the analysis:\n*   **Key Signature:** The piece is in D minor.\n*   **Notes in Measure 8:** The circled notes consist of G#, B, D, and F.\n*   **Chord Identification:** These notes form a G-sharp diminished seventh chord (G#°7). A diminished seventh chord is built by stacking minor thirds.\n*   **Harmonic Function:** This G#°7 chord resolves to an A major chord in the following measure. The A major chord is the dominant (V) of D minor. The G-sharp is the leading tone to A. Therefore, the G#°7 chord is functioning as a secondary leading-tone chord that tonicizes the dominant chord. This relationship is notated as vii°7/V, which reads as \"the leading-tone seventh of the dominant.\"\n\n<<<vii°7/V>>>"
