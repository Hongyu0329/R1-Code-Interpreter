    "The molecular formula of the final product is C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂.\n\nHere is the step-by-step determination:\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is a bicyclic lactam (a cyclic amide) with a trifluoromethyl group (CF₃) and a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group on the nitrogen atom. Its molecular formula is C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂.\n\n2.  **Step 1: PMB Deprotection**\n    *   **Reagents:** Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) in acetonitrile/water (ACN/H₂O).\n    *   **Reaction:** CAN is a standard reagent used for the oxidative removal of the PMB protecting group from an amine. The PMB group (C₈H₈O) is cleaved off, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen.\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** The product is 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    *   **Formula Change:** C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂ - C₈H₈O → C₇H₆F₃NO.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Hydrogenation**\n    *   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas (H₂) in methanol (MeOH).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a classic catalytic hydrogenation, which reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) to a single bond (C-C) by adding two hydrogen atoms. The lactam carbonyl group is generally stable under these conditions.\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** The product is the saturated lactam, 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n    *   **Formula Change:** C₇H₆F₃NO + H₂ → C₇H₈F₃NO.\n\n4.  **Step 3: Lactam Hydrolysis**\n    *   **Reagents:** 4 N Hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 70 °C.\n    *   **Reaction:** These conditions (strong acid and heat) cause the hydrolysis of the lactam (cyclic amide) bond. The ring opens by adding a molecule of water (H₂O) across the amide bond, forming a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **Product:** The bicyclic structure opens to form a substituted cyclopentane ring containing a carboxylic acid group, an amine group, and the trifluoromethyl group. The resulting amino acid is a derivative of 3-amino-cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Formula Change:** C₇H₈F₃NO + H₂O → **C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂**.\n\nTherefore, the final product has a molecular formula of C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂.\n\n<<<C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂>>>"
