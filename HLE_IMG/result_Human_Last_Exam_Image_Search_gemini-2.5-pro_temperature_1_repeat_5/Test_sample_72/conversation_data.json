    "The reaction shown involves two distinct photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions that occur in a sequence.\n\nThe overall transformation is the reaction of hexafluorobenzene with cyclobutene to yield a complex tricyclic product under the influence of light (hv). This happens in two main steps:\n\n1.  **Valence Isomerization of Hexafluorobenzene:** The first reaction is the photochemical isomerization of hexafluorobenzene into its valence isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This type of reaction, which converts benzene derivatives into their highly strained \"Dewar\" forms, is a known photochemical process. This transformation can be classified in two ways under the principles of pericyclic reactions:\n    *   **Intramolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition:** This is a common description, where two non-adjacent pi bonds of the benzene ring react with each other to form a new four-membered ring. Photochemical [2+2] cycloadditions are allowed reactions.\n    *   **4π-Electrocyclic Ring-Closing:** Focusing on four of the six pi-electrons, the reaction can also be viewed as a photochemically allowed disrotatory 4π-electrocyclization.\n\n2.  **Intermolecular [2+2] Photocycloaddition:** The highly strained hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene formed in the first step then undergoes a reaction with cyclobutene. This second step is an intermolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition between one of the double bonds of the Dewar-benzene and the double bond of the cyclobutene molecule. This reaction forms the central four-membered ring seen in the final product, fusing the two reactant skeletons together. This type of reaction is a classic example of a photochemically allowed pericyclic reaction.\n\nTherefore, the two pericyclic reactions involved are:\n\n<<<An intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition (or 4π-electrocyclization) followed by an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition.>>>"
