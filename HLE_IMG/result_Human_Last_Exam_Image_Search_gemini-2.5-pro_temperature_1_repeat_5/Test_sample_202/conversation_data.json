    "Based on the visual characteristics and the information gathered, here is the identification of each rock specimen:\n\n*   **Specimen H: Scoria**\n    This rock is an extrusive igneous rock. Its reddish-brown color is due to the oxidation of iron. It is characterized by its high porosity and numerous cavities, known as vesicles, which give it a sponge-like appearance. These vesicles form when gas bubbles are trapped as lava cools and solidifies. While similar to pumice, scoria has larger vesicles with thicker walls, making it denser. It is often referred to as \"lava rock\" and is used in landscaping and construction.\n\n*   **Specimen I: Volcanic Breccia**\n    This rock is composed of large, angular fragments of other rocks cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This texture indicates it is a type of breccia. Given the context of the other volcanic specimens, it is identifiable as a volcanic breccia, which forms from the shattered rock fragments and ash of an explosive volcanic eruption. The fragments can include various types of volcanic material such as lava, glass, and other rocks plucked from the volcano's conduit.\n\n*   **Specimen J: Pumice**\n    This is a light-colored, extrusive igneous rock with a frothy appearance. It is a type of volcanic glass that is so porous and low in density that it can often float on water. Its formation occurs during explosive volcanic eruptions when viscous, gas-rich magma cools rapidly, trapping bubbles within the structure. The vesicles in pumice are typically smaller and more numerous than in scoria. It is commonly used as an abrasive and in lightweight building materials.\n\n*   **Specimen K: Pegmatite**\n    This is an intrusive igneous rock known for its exceptionally large, interlocking crystals. The crystals are typically larger than one centimeter. Most pegmatites have a composition similar to granite, consisting mainly of quartz, feldspar, and mica. The very coarse-grained texture is a result of slow crystallization from a water-rich magma in the final stages of a magma body's cooling. Pegmatites can be sources of valuable minerals and gemstones.\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Volcanic Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
