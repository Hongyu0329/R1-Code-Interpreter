    "The image displays a bryophyte with a very distinct morphology, characterized by its vibrant green, screw-like shoots formed by tightly curled and spirally arranged leaves. This characteristic appearance is a key identifier.\n\nBased on these features, the plant belongs to the genus ***Tortula***, commonly known as **screw mosses**. The name *Tortula* is derived from the way the peristome teeth (structures around the mouth of the spore capsule) twist together, but it also aptly describes the corkscrew-like appearance of the shoots when the plant is dry.\n\nSeveral species within this genus, such as *Tortula muralis* (wall screw-moss), exhibit leaves that twist and press together when dry, creating the tightly coiled shape seen in the photograph. While many mosses have spirally arranged leaves, the pronounced screw or corkscrew-like curling is particularly characteristic of this group. Other mosses like *Atrichum* can also form a corkscrew shape when their leaves dry out.\n\n<<<Tortula>>>"
