Product A has the molecular formula C14H20N2O3, Product B has the molecular formula C12H14N2O3, and Product C has the molecular formula C11H16N2O3. Product C is the N-acetylated starting material. Product A is the major product resulting from a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of a münchnone intermediate with methyl propiolate, followed by decarboxylation and hydration. Product B is a side product from an alternative reaction of the münchnone intermediate.
