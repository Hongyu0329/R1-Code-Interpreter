    "The Ingvar runestone depicted in the image fragment is identified as **Sö 179**, also known as the Gripsholm Runestone.\n\nThis stone is one of approximately 26 Ingvar runestones, which were raised to commemorate those who died in a Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled between 1036 and 1041. The stone is located at Gripsholm Castle in Mariefred, Södermanland, Sweden.\n\nThe inscription on the stone was commissioned by a woman named Tóla in memory of her son Harald, who was Ingvar's brother. The full translated text reads: \"Tóla had this stone raised in memory of her son Haraldr, Ingvarr's brother. They travelled valiantly far for gold, and in the east gave (food) to the eagle. (They) died in the south in Serkland.\" The phrase \"gave (food) to the eagle\" is a kenning, or a poetic phrase, for killing enemies in battle.\n\nThe runestone was discovered in the 1820s being used as a threshold in the cellar of Gripsholm Castle. It was moved to its current location near the castle entrance in 1930. The carving is considered to be in the runestone style Fp and is noted for its poetic inscription in the fornyrðislag meter.\n\n<<<Sö 179>>>"
