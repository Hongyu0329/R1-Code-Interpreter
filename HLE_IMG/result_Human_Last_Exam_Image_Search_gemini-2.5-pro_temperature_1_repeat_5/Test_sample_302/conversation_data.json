    "The characters on the seal, read from top to bottom and right to left, are 万事如意 (wàn shì rú yì). This is a common Chinese idiom used to express good wishes.\n\nThe four characters in simplified Chinese are:\n*   **万 (wàn):** meaning \"ten thousand\" or \"all\"\n*   **事 (shì):** meaning \"matters\" or \"affairs\"\n*   **如 (rú):** meaning \"as\" or \"like\"\n*   **意 (yì):** meaning \"wish\" or \"will\"\n\nTogether, the phrase **万事如意 (wàn shì rú yì)** translates to \"May all your wishes come true\" or \"May everything go as you wish.\" It is a popular greeting, especially during the Chinese New Year. Seals with this inscription are widely available.\n\n<<<万事如意>>>"
