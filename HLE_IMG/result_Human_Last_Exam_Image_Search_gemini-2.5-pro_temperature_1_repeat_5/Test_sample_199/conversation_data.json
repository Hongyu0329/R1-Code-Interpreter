    "This elaborate 18th-century scientific instrument is the large electrostatic generator of the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, the Netherlands. It was designed by the museum's first director, Martinus van Marum, and constructed by John Cuthbertson in Amsterdam in 1784.\n\nAt the time of its creation, it was the largest and most powerful instrument of its kind in the world. The machine consists of two large glass discs, each 1.65 meters in diameter, which are turned by a crank with four wooden handles. This rotation generates static electricity through friction, which could produce large sparks and a potential of up to 330,000 volts. The generator was used for scientific demonstrations and experiments, and was once demonstrated for Napoleon Bonaparte in 1811. The entire apparatus is mounted on an ornate wooden cabinet, which was designed to match the museum's original Oval Room where it was first displayed.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. Steam engine: Incorrect. It is not powered by steam and lacks the typical components of a steam engine.\nB. Electrostatic Generator: Correct. This is confirmed by multiple sources describing the instrument.\nC. Brass telescope: Incorrect. It is not an optical instrument for viewing distant objects.\nD. Vacuum pump: Incorrect. Although van Marum also worked with vacuum pumps, this specific device is an electrostatic generator.\nE. Orrery: Incorrect. It is not a model of the solar system.\n\n<<<B>>>"
