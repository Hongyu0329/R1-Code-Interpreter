**Product A:**
The structure of Product A (C₁₄H₂₀N₂O₃) is a complex, rearranged product resulting from the reaction of the initial dipole with methyl propiolate, followed by further transformation and acetylation.

**Product B:**
The structure of Product B (C₁₂H₁₄N₂O₃) is a tricyclic system formed from the [3+2] cycloaddition of the mesoionic dipole with methyl propiolate, followed by rearrangement.
