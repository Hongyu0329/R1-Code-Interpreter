    "The X Y is a **hat trick**.\n\nHere's how the clues connect:\n\n*   **The Picture**: The image shows Russian ice hockey player Nikita Kucherov receiving the Ted Lindsay Award on June 19, 2019 (the prompt's date is off by one day). As a high-scoring forward for the Tampa Bay Lightning, Kucherov is strongly associated with the hockey term \"hat trick,\" which is when a player scores three goals in a single game. That season, he won the Art Ross Trophy as the league's leading scorer, the Hart Memorial Trophy for MVP, and the Ted Lindsay Award for the most outstanding player as voted by his peers.\n\n*   **The Toxic History**: The term \"hat trick\" originated in cricket in 1858, where a bowler who achieved a notable feat (taking three consecutive wickets) was rewarded with a new hat. During that era, felt hats were commonly made using a process called \"carroting,\" which involved treating animal fur with mercury nitrate. This process was highly toxic, and chronic exposure led to mercury poisoning among hat makers, a condition known as \"mad hatter disease.\" The use of mercury in hat making was eventually banned in the United States in the early 1940s due to its severe health effects.\n\nTherefore, the term \"hat trick\" connects a modern hockey achievement to a historical manufacturing process that was discontinued because of the toxicity of mercury salts.\n\n<<<Hat trick>>>"
