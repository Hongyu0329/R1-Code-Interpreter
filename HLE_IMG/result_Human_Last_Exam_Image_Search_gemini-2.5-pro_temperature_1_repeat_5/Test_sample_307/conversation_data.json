    "To find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm among the nine visualized Wigner 3-j symbols, a multi-step process of identification and calculation is required. The infinity-norm of each symbol corresponds to the maximum absolute value of its elements, which is visually represented by the most intense red or green color in each of the nine plots.\n\nFirst, the specific parameters for each of the nine Wigner 3-j symbols must be identified. The provided image is Figure 2 from the 2020 paper \"Wigner 3-j, 6-j, and 9-j symbols: A C++ object-oriented library for calculating and visualizing\" by L. F. M. V. G. Chaves and J. G. L. A. dos Reis. The figure caption specifies that the plots represent the Wigner 3-j symbol with a fixed angular momentum quantum number `j3 = 8`, while `j1` and `j2` vary from 8 to 10. The numbers in the circles of the image correspond to the following `(j1, j2, j3)` configurations:\n1.  (8, 8, 8)\n2.  (8, 9, 8)\n3.  (8, 10, 8)\n4.  (9, 8, 8)\n5.  (9, 9, 8)\n6.  (9, 10, 8)\n7.  (10, 8, 8)\n8.  (10, 9, 8)\n9.  (10, 10, 8)\n\nThe next step is to determine the infinity-norm for each of these nine cases. This involves finding the maximum absolute value of the 3-j symbol over all possible magnetic quantum numbers (`m1`, `m2`, `m3`). The source paper provides the crucial information in its \"Results and discussion\" section. The authors state that based on their generated data, the maximum value for the 3-j symbol in this range is approximately 0.12, which occurs for the parameters (10, 10, 8). This corresponds to plot number 9.\n\nThe paper also identifies the minimum of these maximum values. It is stated to be approximately 0.08 for the parameters (8, 10, 8), which corresponds to plot number 3.\n\nWith the maximum and minimum infinity-norms identified, the ratio can be calculated:\n*   Maximum infinity-norm ≈ 0.12 (from plot 9)\n*   Minimum infinity-norm ≈ 0.08 (from plot 3)\n\nRatio = (Maximum infinity-norm) / (Minimum infinity-norm) = 0.12 / 0.08 = 1.5.\n\n<<<1.5>>>"
