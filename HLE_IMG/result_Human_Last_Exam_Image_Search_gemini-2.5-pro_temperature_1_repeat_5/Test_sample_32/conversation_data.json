    "The main and most evident difference in the sporophyte for distinguishing *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the shape of the seta, which is the stalk that supports the capsule.\n\nIn *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight and erect. The capsules, though often rare, are held up on these short, straight stalks.\n\nConversely, *Grimmia curviseta* is characterized by its curved or arcuate seta. This feature is so defining that it is reflected in its species name, *curviseta*.\n\nTherefore, a quick look at whether the capsule's stalk is straight or curved is the primary way to differentiate the sporophytes of these two species.\n\n<<<The key difference is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a curved (arcuate) seta.>>>"
