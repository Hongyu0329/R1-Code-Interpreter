The S100B protein has a strong affinity for the V-domain of the RAGE receptor. It could be used as a prognostic marker because its levels correlate with the severity and progression of neurodegenerative pathology. It would also be considered an adjunct marker because it is not specific to a single neurological disorder and must be used in conjunction with other diagnostic tests.
