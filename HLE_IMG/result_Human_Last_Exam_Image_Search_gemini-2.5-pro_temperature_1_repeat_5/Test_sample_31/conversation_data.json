    "The knot depicted in the image is the 8₁₈ knot in the Rolfsen table.\n\nThe Rasmussen s-invariant is a powerful integer-valued invariant of a knot that arises from Khovanov homology. It provides a lower bound for the smooth 4-genus of a knot. For alternating knots, the Rasmussen s-invariant is equal to the knot signature.\n\nAccording to the Knot Atlas, the Rasmussen s-invariant for the 8₁₈ knot is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
