    "This reaction is a classic example of an acid-catalyzed backbone rearrangement of a pentacyclic triterpenoid. The starting material is friedelan-3β-ol. Under acidic conditions and heat, the alcohol is protonated and eliminated as a water molecule, which initiates a cascade of shifts of methyl groups (CH₃) and hydride ions (H⁻).\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the rearrangement:\n\n1.  **Carbocation Formation:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) at position C3 is protonated by the acid catalyst (HCl) and leaves as a water molecule (H₂O). This generates a secondary carbocation at the C3 position.\n\n2.  **Rearrangement Cascade:** The initial carbocation is unstable and undergoes a series of shifts to form a more stable carbocation. This cascade proceeds as follows (using standard triterpenoid numbering):\n    *   A methyl group from C4 migrates to C3. The positive charge moves to C4.\n    *   A hydride from C5 migrates to C4. The positive charge moves to C5.\n    *   The methyl group from C10 migrates to C5. The positive charge moves to C10.\n    *   A hydride from C9 migrates to C10. The positive charge moves to C9.\n    *   The methyl group from C8 migrates to C9. The positive charge moves to C8.\n    *   The methyl group from C14 migrates to C8. The positive charge moves to C14.\n    *   A hydride from C13 migrates to C14. The positive charge moves to C13.\n\n3.  **Elimination:** The rearrangement cascade stops when the positive charge is at C13. A proton is then eliminated from the adjacent C12, forming a stable trisubstituted double bond between C12 and C13. The final product is Olean-12-ene.\n\n*Note: The drawing of the product in the question contains a common error; it incorrectly shows two methyl groups at the C4 position. The actual product of this well-known rearrangement, Olean-12-ene, has only one methyl group and one hydrogen at C4.*\n\nBased on this established mechanism, we can determine the final substituents at the numbered positions:\n\n*   **Position 1 (at C4):** This carbon started with two methyl groups. One migrated away, and a hydrogen from C5 migrated to it. Therefore, the remaining substituent is a **CH₃**.\n*   **Position 2 (at C10):** The original methyl group at C10 migrated to C5. A hydrogen from C9 moved to C10. Therefore, the substituent is an **H**.\n*   **Position 3 (at C5):** The original hydrogen at C5 migrated to C4. The methyl group from C10 moved to C5. Therefore, the substituent is a **CH₃**.\n*   **Position 4 (at C8):** The original methyl group at C8 migrated to C9. The methyl group from C14 moved to C8. Therefore, the substituent is a **CH₃**.\n*   **Position 5 (at C14):** The original methyl group at C14 migrated to C8. A hydrogen from C13 moved to C14. Therefore, the substituent is an **H**.\n\nThe final answer is:\n1 = CH₃, 2 = H, 3 = CH₃, 4 = CH₃, 5 = H\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
