    "Based on the transformations shown in the reaction scheme, the reagents A and B can be identified as follows:\n\n**Reagent A: Hydrazine (N₂H₄)**\n\nThe first step of the reaction converts compound **1**, a pyrylium-type salt (specifically a dibenzo[a,j]xanthenylium derivative), into compound **2**. In this transformation, a ring oxygen atom is replaced by a nitrogen atom bearing an amino group (-NH₂). This specific conversion of a pyrylium salt into an N-aminopyridinium salt is a well-known chemical reaction achieved by using hydrazine as the reagent.\n\n**Reagent B: Butyraldehyde (Butanal, CH₃CH₂CH₂CHO)**\n\nThe second step converts compound **2**, an N-aminoacridinium salt, into compound **3**, an N-propyl-quinacridinium salt. This transformation involves a complex rearrangement where the remaining oxygen-containing ring and the N-amino group react to form the final quinacridinium structure. A key change is the introduction of an N-propyl group. This reaction has been documented in the chemical literature, where heating an N-aminoacridinium salt with butyraldehyde (also known as butanal) leads to the formation of the corresponding N-propyl-quinacridinium salt. The butyraldehyde provides the necessary carbon atoms and the propyl group for the new ring system.\n\nTherefore, the reagents are:\n*   **A:** Hydrazine\n*   **B:** Butyraldehyde\n\n<<<Reagent A is hydrazine (N₂H₄) and Reagent B is butyraldehyde (CH₃CH₂CH₂CHO).>>>"
