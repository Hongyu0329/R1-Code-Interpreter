    "The analysis of the Google Trends graph indicates recurring annual peaks in search interest, which strongly suggests these are related to national holidays or annual commemorative events. By examining the timing of these peaks and correlating them with national holidays of various countries, a clear match emerges for Italy.\n\nHere is a breakdown of how the trend lines correspond to significant Italian historical events:\n\n*   **The Yellow Line:** This line shows a very prominent peak around the beginning of June each year. This corresponds to the **Festa della Repubblica** (Republic Day), Italy's National Day, celebrated on June 2nd. This holiday commemorates the 1946 referendum where Italians voted to abolish the monarchy and establish a republic. The main celebration, including a military parade, takes place in Rome.\n\n*   **The Blue Line:** This line consistently peaks at the end of April. This timing aligns with Italy's **Festa della Liberazione** (Liberation Day) on April 25th. This important holiday marks the end of the Nazi occupation and the fascist regime in 1945, a key moment in the nation's history.\n\n*   **The Red Line:** This line has two noticeable peaks during the year. The first, and generally larger, peak occurs in late January. This matches the **Giorno della Memoria** (Holocaust Memorial Day), an international day of remembrance observed in Italy on January 27th to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust. A second, smaller peak in November corresponds to the **Giorno dell'Unit√† Nazionale e Giornata delle Forze Armate** (National Unity and Armed Forces Day) on November 4th. This date marks the armistice that ended World War I for Italy in 1918.\n\nThe consistent alignment of these three distinct search trends with major Italian historical commemorations makes it evident that the country in question is Italy.\n\n<<<Italy>>>"
