    "The spectral lines shown in the image belong to the element Uranium. The emission spectrum of uranium is known to be very complex, with a large number of lines spanning the entire visible spectrum, which is consistent with the provided image.\n\nUranium has a strong emission line at 591.5 nm, and its spectrum is characterized by hundreds of emission lines from neutral uranium (UI) and singly ionized uranium (UII). The complexity of the spectrum is due to the dense electronic structures of its excited states.\n\nStudies of uranium's spectral lines are used for various purposes, including the quantitative determination of different uranium isotopes.\n\n<<<Uranium>>>"
