    "Based on the visual evidence in the image, this photo was taken in Seattle, Washington.\n\nThe key features in the photograph—a sandy beach adjacent to a forested bluff, a body of water consistent with Puget Sound at sunset, the presence of beach bonfires, and a distinctive chain-link fence separating a path from the beach—strongly point to Golden Gardens Park. This popular Seattle park is well-known for allowing beach bonfires in designated pits, a practice that was in effect in 2022.\n\nThe viewpoint appears to be from the southern portion of the park, looking northwest along the shoreline. This area features a trail and an off-leash dog park on a slope above the beach, which is separated by a chain-link fence, matching the scene in the photo.\n\n<<<Seattle>>>"
