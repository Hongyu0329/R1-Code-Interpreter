    "The artist of the painting is the Polish surrealist painter Jacek Yerka. Born in Toru≈Ñ, Poland, in 1952, Yerka is known for his fantastical and dreamlike landscapes that often blend elements of reality with imaginative scenarios.\n\nYerka's work is characterized by its meticulous detail and vibrant colors, drawing inspiration from his childhood memories of the 1950s, as well as from early Netherlandish painters like Hieronymus Bosch and Jan van Eyck. He studied fine art and graphic design, and despite pressure from his instructors to adopt a more contemporary, abstract style, he remained committed to his detailed and realistic technique.\n\nHis paintings often feature whimsical architecture, extraordinary beasts, and the juxtaposition of indoor and outdoor spaces, as seen in the provided image where a room opens up to a seascape and a landscape of ice. This particular style of creating surreal compositions has earned him international acclaim, with exhibitions in countries such as Germany, France, and the United States.\n\n<<<Jacek Yerka>>>"
