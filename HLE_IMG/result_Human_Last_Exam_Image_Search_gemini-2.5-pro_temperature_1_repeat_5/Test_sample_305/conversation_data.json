    "The product featured in advertisements aimed at new female workers in World War II Britain was the French-named cosmetics brand **Bourjois**.\n\nDuring the war, British women were recruited into factories and other traditionally male jobs to support the war effort. Advertisements for the French cosmetics company Bourjois, and particularly its \"Evening in Paris\" (Soir de Paris) line, targeted these women. The campaign suggested that maintaining one's appearance and femininity was a way to boost morale and contribute to the war effort, thus helping women overcome the psychological challenges of their new roles.\n\nThe branding, including names like \"Bourjois,\" \"Soir de Paris,\" and perfumes called \"Courage,\" was distinctly French, associating the products with glamour and sophistication. These products, including powders, perfumes, and makeup compacts, were widely popular and sold in numerous department stores and chemists.\n\n<<<Bourjois>>>"
