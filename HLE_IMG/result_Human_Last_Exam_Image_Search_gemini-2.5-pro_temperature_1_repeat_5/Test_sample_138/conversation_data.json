    "Here is the determination of the biological sexes for each pair of insects:\n\n**A) *Coelioxys* (Cuckoo Bees)**\n\n*   **A-Left (Female):** This individual displays a long, conical, and sharply pointed abdomen. This is a characteristic feature of female *Coelioxys* bees, which use this specialized abdomen to pierce the nests of host bees to lay their eggs.\n*   **A-Right (Male):** This bee has a distinctly different abdomen tip that is armed with multiple spines or prongs. This multi-pronged structure is a key characteristic of male *Coelioxys*.\n\nTherefore, the pair in A is Female, Male (F, M).\n\n**B) *Polistes* (Paper Wasps)**\n\n*   **B-Left (Female):** This wasp has relatively straight and shorter antennae. Female paper wasps are characterized by their straight antennae.\n*   **B-Right (Male):** This individual exhibits antennae that are distinctly curled or hooked at the tips. Curled antennae are a reliable indicator of a male paper wasp.\n\nTherefore, the pair in B is Female, Male (F, M).\n\n**C) Eucerini (Long-horned Bees)**\n\n*   **C-Left (Male):** This bee is distinguished by its exceptionally long antennae, which are characteristic of males in the Eucerini tribe, giving them the common name \"long-horned bees\". Additionally, males in this group often have a yellow or pale clypeus (the plate on the face above the mandibles), which is visible in the image.\n*   **C-Right (Female):** This bee has much shorter antennae compared to the male. Female long-horned bees have standard-length antennae.\n\nTherefore, the pair in C is Male, Female (M, F).\n\nCombining these findings, the correct indices for A, B, and C are:\nA: F, M (4)\nB: F, M (4)\nC: M, F (3)\n\n<<<4, 4, 3>>>"
