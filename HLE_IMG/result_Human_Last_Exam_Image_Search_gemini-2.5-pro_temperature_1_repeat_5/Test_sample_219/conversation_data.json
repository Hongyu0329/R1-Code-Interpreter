    "Based on the visual analysis of the provided raster plot, the synchronized bursts and the average inter-burst interval are determined as follows:\n\n**1. Identification of Synchronized Bursts:**\nSynchronized bursts are identified as the dense vertical bands where a large number of electrodes fire simultaneously. The approximate time points for the center of these bursts are:\n*   **Burst 1:** ~3 s\n*   **Burst 2:** ~17 s\n*   **Burst 3:** ~27 s\n*   **Burst 4:** ~37 s\n*   **Burst 5:** ~49 s\n\n**2. Calculation of Inter-Burst Intervals (IBI):**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time elapsed between consecutive synchronized bursts.\n*   **Interval 1:** 17 s - 3 s = 14 s\n*   **Interval 2:** 27 s - 17 s = 10 s\n*   **Interval 3:** 37 s - 27 s = 10 s\n*   **Interval 4:** 49 s - 37 s = 12 s\n\n**3. Calculation of Average Inter-Burst Interval:**\nThe average inter-burst interval is the mean of the calculated intervals.\n*   **Average IBI** = (14 s + 10 s + 10 s + 12 s) / 4 = 46 s / 4 = 11.5 s\n\nRounding this to two significant figures gives **12 s**.\n\n<<<12 s>>>"
