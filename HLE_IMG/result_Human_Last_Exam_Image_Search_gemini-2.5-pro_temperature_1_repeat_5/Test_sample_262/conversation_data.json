    "The operational lifetime of light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) is a critical parameter influenced by the chemical stability of the emitter complex. For the iridium(III) complexes shown, a key factor in their stability is the strength and integrity of the cyclometalating bond between the iridium center and the phenyl ring (Ir-C bond).\n\n**Analysis of the Complexes:**\n\n*   **Complex 1 ([Ir(ppy)2(dtbbpy)]+):** This is a widely used and relatively stable reference complex with two unsubstituted 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) cyclometalating ligands.\n*   **Complex 2 ([Ir(dfppy)2(dtbbpy)]+):** This complex features fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring of the cyclometalating ligand (2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine). Electron-withdrawing fluorine substituents generally stabilize the complex by lowering its HOMO energy level, making it more resistant to oxidation, and strengthening the Ir-C bond. This often leads to *longer* device lifetimes.\n*   **Complex 3 ([Ir(F-ortho-ppy)2(dtbbpy)]+):** This complex has a single fluorine atom at the ortho-position of the phenyl ring (adjacent to the Ir-C bond). This substituent introduces significant steric hindrance.\n*   **Complex 4 ([Ir(dF-ortho-ppy)2(dtbbpy)]+):** This complex has fluorine atoms at both ortho-positions of the phenyl ring. This arrangement creates even more severe steric strain around the Ir-C bond.\n\n**Impact of Steric Hindrance:**\n\nSubstituents at the ortho-position of the phenyl ring in cyclometalated complexes induce steric strain. This strain can distort the geometry of the complex, weaken the crucial Ir-C bond, and create a pathway for degradation. Research indicates that such steric clashes can prevent tight binding to the iridium center. While fluorination elsewhere on the ring is a common strategy for improving stability, ortho-fluorination can have the opposite effect. Specifically, fluorination at the ortho position can enhance the non-radiative decay rate of the complex, which is detrimental to its function as an emitter.\n\nBoth Complex 3 and Complex 4 possess ortho-fluorine substituents, with Complex 4 being the more sterically hindered of the two. This increased steric strain is expected to significantly weaken the Ir-C bond, making these complexes more susceptible to degradation under the electrochemical stress of LEC operation. Consequently, Complexes 3 and 4 are predicted to have shorter operational lifetimes compared to the less sterically hindered Complexes 1 and 2.\n\nTherefore, the complexes expected to show shorter lifetimes are and.\n\n<<<J>>>"
