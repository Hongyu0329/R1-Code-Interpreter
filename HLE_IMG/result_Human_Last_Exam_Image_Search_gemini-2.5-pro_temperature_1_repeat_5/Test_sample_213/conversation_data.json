    "The sheet music provided is the opening of the second act of the opera **Elektra** by Richard Strauss.\n\nThe opera, a one-act work, is known for its modernist and expressionist style. It was composed between 1906 and 1908 and first performed in Dresden in 1909. The libretto was written by Hugo von Hofmannsthal, adapted from his own 1903 drama.\n\nWhile both *Salome* and *Elektra* are famous one-act operas by Strauss with a large orchestra and a modern harmonic language, a close look at the score and plot details confirms the piece is from *Elektra*. The specific musical passage can be found at the beginning of the scene labeled \"Ich kann nicht sitzen und ins Dunkel starren\" (\"I cannot sit and stare into the darkness\"), which functions as the start of the second part of this continuous one-act opera, immediately following Klytaemnestra's entrance. The direction \"(Vorhang)\" or \"(Curtain)\" in this context signifies a major scene change or development rather than a traditional act break with an intermission.\n\nThe instrumentation listed in the score, including \"2 gr. Fl.\" (2 large flutes), \"I. Hob.\" (1st oboe), \"engl. Horn\" (English Horn), and strings, is consistent with the massive orchestral forces required for *Elektra*.\n\n<<<Elektra>>>"
