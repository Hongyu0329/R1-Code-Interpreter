    "Based on a detailed analysis of the score, measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata contains two distinct harmonies that create a strong drive toward the tonic chord in the following measure.\n\nThe key of the sonata is C minor. Measure 30 is part of a transitional passage that solidifies the dominant harmony to lead back to the main theme.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the harmony within measure 30:\n*   **Beats 1 and 2:** The first half of the measure features an F-sharp diminished seventh chord (F♯–A–C–E♭) in the right hand over a G in the bass. This chord functions as a secondary leading-tone chord, specifically the leading-tone seventh of the dominant (V). In Roman numerals, this is written as **vii°7/V**.\n*   **Beats 3 and 4:** The second half of the measure consists of a G dominant seventh chord (G–B♮–D–F) in the right hand, also over a G in the bass. This is the dominant seventh chord of the home key, C minor. The Roman numeral for this chord is **V7**.\n\nThe entire measure functions as dominant preparation. The vii°7/V in the first half is an embellishment that intensifies the arrival of the V7 chord in the second half, which then resolves to the C minor tonic chord in measure 31. While two chords are present, the primary and resolving harmony that defines the measure's function in the larger context is the dominant seventh.\n\n<<<V7 (preceded by its own leading-tone chord, vii°7/V)>>>"
