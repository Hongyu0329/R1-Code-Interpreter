    "The image was taken in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nThe buildings visible in the photograph are landmarks in the city's downtown area. On the left is the Mirae Asset Center 1 building, and to its right are the twin Signature Towers. These buildings are located in the Jung District (Jung-gu) of Seoul, near the Cheonggyecheon Stream, a popular public recreation space that runs through the heart of the city.\n\nThe Mirae Asset Center 1 is a 32-story building known for its glass and white aluminum panel facade. The Signature Towers are a two-tower complex with 17 floors above ground that serves as a major office location. The perspective of the photograph suggests it was likely taken from the area around the Cheonggyecheon Stream, which is known for offering views of the surrounding modern architecture.\n\n<<<Seoul>>>"
