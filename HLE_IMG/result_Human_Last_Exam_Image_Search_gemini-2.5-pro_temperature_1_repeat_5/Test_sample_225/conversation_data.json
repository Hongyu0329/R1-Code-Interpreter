    "The reaction shown involves a starting material, tris(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)methylium ion, being treated with 0.1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) under reflux for 12 hours. These conditions—strong acid, heat, and prolonged reaction time—are characteristic of the acidic cleavage of ethers.\n\nThe starting material, tris(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)methylium ion, is a carbocation (a methylium ion) attached to three phenyl rings. Each of these rings possesses two methoxy groups (-OCH₃) at positions 2 and 3. Methoxy groups are a type of ether.\n\nUnder the given reaction conditions, the ether linkages of the methoxy groups will be cleaved. This acid-catalyzed hydrolysis reaction proceeds as follows:\n1.  The oxygen atom of a methoxy group is protonated by the strong acid (HCl), making it a better leaving group (methanol, CH₃OH).\n2.  A nucleophile, which in this aqueous solution is water (H₂O), attacks the carbon atom of the methyl group, displacing methanol and forming a hydroxyl group (-OH) on the aromatic ring.\n\nThis process will occur for all six methoxy groups present in the starting molecule. Each methoxy group (Ar-OCH₃) will be converted into a hydroxyl group (Ar-OH).\n\nTherefore, the final product, compound A, will be the tris(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)methylium ion. The central carbocation structure and the three phenyl rings remain intact, but all six methoxy groups are replaced by hydroxyl groups.\n\nFinal Product (A): **Tris(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)methylium ion**\n\nChemical Structure of A:\n```\n      OH\n     /\n(HO-Ph)₃-C⁺\n```\nWhere each Ph is a benzene ring with hydroxyl groups at positions 2 and 3 relative to the bond with the central carbon atom.\n\n<<<Tris(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)methylium ion"
