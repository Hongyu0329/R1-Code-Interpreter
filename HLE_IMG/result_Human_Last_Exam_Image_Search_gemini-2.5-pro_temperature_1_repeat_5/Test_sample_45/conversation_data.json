    "Upon examining the provided image, the tiling displays a clear and repeating structural motif that allows for the determination of its rotational symmetry.\n\nThe most prominent shapes in the pattern are the dark blue, seven-sided polygons, which are regular heptagons. By focusing on the center of any of these heptagons, it is evident that the arrangement of the surrounding tiles—the yellow squares and orange rhombi—is identical around each of the seven sides.\n\nIf the entire pattern is rotated by an angle of 360/7 degrees (approximately 51.4 degrees) around the center of a heptagon, it will perfectly align with its original position. This indicates that the tiling possesses **7-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\nThis type of symmetry is a hallmark of aperiodic tilings, also known as quasicrystalline tilings. Unlike periodic tilings (like a standard chessboard or hexagonal honeycomb pattern), which can only have 2, 3, 4, or 6-fold rotational symmetry, aperiodic tilings can exhibit symmetries that were once thought to be impossible for crystals. Such tilings, including those with 7-fold symmetry, can be constructed using a specific set of tiles and rules for how they fit together.\n\n<<<7-fold>>>"
