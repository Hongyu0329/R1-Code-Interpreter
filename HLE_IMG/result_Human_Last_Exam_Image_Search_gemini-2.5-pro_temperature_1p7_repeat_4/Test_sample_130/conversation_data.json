    "Based on the visual evidence presented in the image, the spectral lines belong to the element **Tin (Sn)**.\n\nA detailed analysis of the emission spectrum shows a characteristic pattern of lines distributed across the visible light spectrum. This includes distinct lines in the red, yellow-green, and blue regions.\n\nThis observed pattern uniquely corresponds to the known emission spectrum of Tin. Specifically, a defining feature of Tin's spectrum is the \"pattern of two close together red lines, a few yellow-green, and then two close together blue lines, in an almost evenly spaced configuration\". This description accurately reflects the arrangement of the spectral lines in the provided image.\n\n<<<Tin>>>"
