    "The epiphytic species in the image belongs to the genus ***Radula***. This is a type of leafy liverwort.\n\nThe organism displays a distinctive dark, net-like or reticulated pattern as it grows flat against the bark of the tree. This appearance is characteristic of some species within the large and diverse *Radula* genus, which comprises nearly 250 recognized species. These liverworts are typically found in moist, sheltered environments, growing on tree trunks, logs, or rocks. While many species are green, some can appear very dark or black, especially when dry, creating the web-like pattern seen in the photograph.\n\nLiverworts are a division of non-vascular plants, and *Radula* is the only genus in the family Radulaceae. They are distinguished from other liverworts by unique features, such as producing rhizoids (root-like structures) directly from their leaf surfaces.\n\nWhile some fungi and crustose lichens can create net-like patterns on bark, the fine, intricate, and flat appearance in the image is very characteristic of certain epiphytic liverworts from the *Radula* genus.\n\n<<<Radula>>>"
