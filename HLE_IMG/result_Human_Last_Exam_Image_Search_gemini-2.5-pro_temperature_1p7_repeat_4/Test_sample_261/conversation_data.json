    "I have conducted thorough searches and have gathered enough evidence to identify the book. The image fragment, which shows a ghostly white unicorn with a golden horn against a dark, tumultuous background, is from the cover of a specific edition of \"The Last Unicorn\" by Peter S. Beagle.\n\nMy research indicates that this particular cover art depicts the scene where the unicorn confronts the Red Bull. While multiple covers exist for this famous novel, the described artwork is strongly associated with it. The artistic style is consistent with fantasy art of the latter half of the 20th century. I have found multiple references to this scene in my search results, which further supports the conclusion. The image presented is a cropped section of the full cover art.\n\nTherefore, based on the visual evidence and the information gathered from the search results, I can confidently identify the book.\n\n<<<The Last Unicorn>>>"
