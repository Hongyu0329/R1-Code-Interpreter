    "The protein depicted in the image is **Caspase-7**.\n\nThis identification is based on the distinct structural features shown in the image, which correspond to the known structure of human procaspase-7, particularly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 1F1I. The image displays the crystal structure of Caspase-7, a member of the cysteine-aspartic acid protease (caspase) family, which plays a critical role in programmed cell death (apoptosis) and inflammation.\n\nKey features visible in the image that lead to this identification include:\n*   **Two-domain structure**: The protein consists of a large catalytic domain (dark blue) and a smaller subunit (part of the light blue N-terminal prodomain). This dimeric structure is characteristic of caspases.\n*   **Prodomain and Subunits**: Caspases are synthesized as inactive zymogens called procaspases. The image shows the proform of caspase-7. Activation involves the cleavage of an inter-subunit linker, which allows the protein to adopt its active conformation. The light blue portion represents this N-terminal region.\n*   **Function**: Caspase-7 is an \"executioner\" caspase, activated by \"initiator\" caspases like caspase-8 and caspase-9. Once active, it cleaves a wide range of cellular proteins, leading to the organized disassembly of the cell during apoptosis. It is also involved in other cellular processes like pyroptosis and inflammation by cleaving specific substrates like GSDMB.\n\nThe structure provided by PDB entry 1F1J shows caspase-7 in complex with a peptide inhibitor, which helps to stabilize and visualize the active site. The overall fold of procaspase-7 is similar to that of the active enzyme, but the active site is blocked until proteolytic cleavage occurs.\n\n<<<Caspase-7>>>"
