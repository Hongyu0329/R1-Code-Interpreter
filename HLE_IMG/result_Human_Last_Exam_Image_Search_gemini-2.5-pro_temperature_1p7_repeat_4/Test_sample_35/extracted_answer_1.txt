Based on the image and current research, S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **V-domain** of the RAGE receptor. It should be considered a **prognostic marker** because its overexpression is not merely a sign of damage but actively drives the key pathological mechanisms of neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and neuronal loss, meaning its levels correlate with and can predict disease progression and severity.
