    "In light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), the operational lifetime of the device is a critical parameter, which is strongly influenced by the chemical stability of the ionic transition metal complex used as the emitter. The degradation of these complexes is a key factor limiting device longevity.\n\nThe four complexes shown are all cationic iridium(III) complexes. They share the same central metal ion (Iridium), the same diimine ancillary ligand (4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine), and the same counter-ion (PF₆⁻). The only difference between them lies in the cyclometalating phenylpyridine (ppy) ligands.\n\n*   **Complex 1** has 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine ligands.\n*   **Complex 2** has unsubstituted 2-phenylpyridine ligands.\n*   **Complex 3** has 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine ligands (ortho-fluorination).\n*   **Complex 4** has 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine ligands (para-fluorination).\n\nThe stability of these emitters, and consequently the LEC lifetime, is significantly affected by the substitution on the phenyl ring of the cyclometalating ligand. A common strategy to enhance the stability of these iridium complexes is to introduce fluorine atoms onto the phenylpyridine ligands.\n\nThere are two main reasons for this enhanced stability:\n1.  **Increased Bond Strength**: Fluorine is a highly electronegative and electron-withdrawing atom. Its presence on the phenyl ring strengthens the critical Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond, making the complex more robust.\n2.  **Chemical Inertness**: The Carbon-Fluorine (C-F) bond is significantly stronger than the Carbon-Hydrogen (C-H) bond it replaces. This makes the ligand less susceptible to chemical attack and degradation during device operation.\n\nBased on these principles, the non-fluorinated complex, **Complex 2**, which has only C-H bonds on the phenyl part of the ligand, is expected to be the least stable. This lower stability leads to faster degradation and, consequently, a shorter operational lifetime for the LEC device.\n\nThe other three complexes (1, 3, and 4) are all fluorinated. While the position and number of fluorine atoms can further tune the stability (with difluorinated Complex 1 generally being the most stable), they are all expected to have greater stability and thus longer lifetimes than the non-fluorinated Complex 2.\n\nTherefore, among the given options, Complex 2 is the one expected to show a shorter lifetime.\n\n<<<B>>>"
