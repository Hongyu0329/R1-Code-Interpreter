    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Observation:** The image displays a community of marine invertebrates on a wet rock, characteristic of a rocky intertidal zone. The organisms present include numerous barnacles and several snails of different types and sizes.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Organisms:**\n    *   **Barnacles:** These are sessile crustaceans with conical shells. They are a common sight in intertidal zones worldwide, so identifying the specific species from the photo is difficult and may not be geographically definitive, as some species have wide distributions or have been introduced to new areas.\n    *   **Snails (Gastropods):** There are at least two distinct types of snails visible.\n        *   One is a relatively large snail with a striped, conical shell. It has brownish spiral bands on a lighter-colored shell. This morphology is characteristic of the Common Periwinkle.\n        *   Another large snail has a whitish, worn shell. This could be a worn Common Periwinkle or another species like a Dog Whelk.\n        *   There are also several smaller, dark-colored snails with ribbed shells. These are likely another species of periwinkle.\n\n3.  **Focusing on the Geographically Distinctive Species:** The question asks for a species that *definitively* indicates the photo was taken on the Atlantic rather than the Pacific Coast. This requires finding an organism whose natural or established range is exclusively on the Atlantic coast (in the context of North America).\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Striped Snail:** The snail with the prominent stripes is the most identifiable candidate. Its features strongly match those of the **Common Periwinkle**, whose scientific name is ***Littorina littorea***.\n\n5.  **Checking the Geographic Distribution of *Littorina littorea*:**\n    *   **Native Range:** *Littorina littorea* is native to the coasts of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean (Europe).\n    *   **Introduced Range:** It was introduced to the Atlantic coast of North America in the mid-19th century. It has since become extremely common and is a dominant species in the intertidal zone from Labrador, Canada, down to Maryland or Virginia, USA.\n    *   **Pacific Coast Presence:** Crucially, *Littorina littorea* is **not** established on the Pacific Coast of North America. While there might be rare, isolated findings, it is not a part of the common, free-living coastal fauna there.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The presence of a thriving population of *Littorina littorea*, as indicated by the clear photo of the live snail in its habitat, is a definitive piece of evidence that the location is on a shore of the Atlantic Ocean (either in North America or Europe) and not the Pacific Ocean. Other species like the Atlantic Dog Whelk (*Nucella lapillus*) are also Atlantic-specific, but the Common Periwinkle is clearly identifiable in the image and serves as a classic indicator species for this distinction.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
