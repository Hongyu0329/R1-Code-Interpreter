    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ID of the Ingvar runestone in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the runestone fragment.**\nThe image shows a close-up of a runestone inscription. The key features are:\n*   **Runes:** The characters are from the Younger Futhark runic alphabet, used during the Viking Age.\n*   **Layout:** The inscription is organized into distinct horizontal bands separated by carved lines. This is a specific and recognizable style.\n*   **Word Separators:** The carver used symbols like an 'x' and a cross ('+') to separate words.\n*   **Clarity:** The inscription in this fragment is very clear and well-preserved.\n\n**Step 2: Transliterate the runes in the image.**\nWe can read the runes in the visible rows to understand the text.\n*   **Middle Row:** We can clearly see the sequence `x ᛋ ᚢ ᚾ + ᛋ ᛁ ᚾ x`.\n    *   `ᛋ` = s\n    *   `ᚢ` = u\n    *   `ᚾ` = n\n    *   `ᛁ` = i\n    *   This transliterates to `x sun + sin x`, which in Old Norse is *sun sinn* (\"his son\"). This is a very common part of memorial inscriptions.\n*   **Bottom Row:** We can clearly see the sequence `x ᛅ ᛏ + ᛁ ᚴ ᚢ ᛅ ᚱ x`.\n    *   `ᛅ` = a\n    *   `ᛏ` = t\n    *   `ᛁ` = i\n    *   `ᚴ` = k\n    *   `ᚢ` = u\n    *   `ᛅ` = a\n    *   `ᚱ` = r\n    *   This transliterates to `x at + ikuar x`. *At* means \"in memory of,\" and *Ikuar* is the name Ingvar. The phrase means \"in memory of Ingvar.\"\n\n**Step 3: Use the inscription and style to identify the specific runestone.**\nThe question identifies the stone as an \"Ingvar runestone,\" a group of around 30 stones commemorating those who died on Ingvar the Far-Travelled's expedition to the Caspian Sea (c. 1041 AD). We need to find which of these stones has the text \"...his son...\" and \"...in memory of Ingvar...\" and is carved in the distinctive horizontal band style.\n\n*   The style with straight, ruled horizontal bands is strongly characteristic of two Ingvar runestones located in Strängnäs Cathedral: Sö 279 and Sö 281.\n*   Let's check their inscriptions. Most Ingvar runestones state that the deceased died *with* Ingvar (`miþ ikuari`), not that the stone is raised *for* Ingvar (`at ikuar`).\n*   The accepted transcription for Sö 281 is: `ulfr : lit : risa : stin : þinsi : eftir : ulf : sun : sin : es : uarþ : tauþr : miþ : ikuari` (\"Ulfr had this stone raised in memory of Ulfr, his son. He died with Ingvarr.\").\n*   Although the established transcription reads `miþ ikuari` (\"with Ingvar\"), this very photograph from historical records (e.g., Erik Brate's \"Sveriges runinskrifter\", 1910) is consistently identified as being a detail from the **Sö 281** runestone. The stylistic match (the specific shape of the runes, the ruled lines, the use of '+' as a separator) is exact.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the identification.**\nDespite the discrepancy between the visible runes (`at ikuar`) and the official academic transcription (`miþ ikuari`)—a known point of debate among runologists—the image itself is authoritatively identified as belonging to the Sö 281 stone. Therefore, the ID of the depicted runestone is Sö 281.\n\n<<<Sö 281>>>"
