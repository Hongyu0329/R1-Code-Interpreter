    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Image Identification:** The image displays a circular relief sculpture (a tondo) set within a larger, ornate frame. The style is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance. The material appears to be sculpted and possibly glazed, a technique famously used by a particular Florentine workshop.\n2.  **Subject Matter:** The central scene depicts a religious ceremony. A priest is administering the Eucharist (Holy Communion) to a group of kneeling figures, including a child. This identifies the scene as one of the Seven Sacraments of the Catholic Church.\n3.  **Inscription Analysis:** At the bottom of the tondo, there is a cartouche with the inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This is an archaic form of Italian that translates to \"Sacraments of the Altar,\" confirming the subject matter of the altarpiece from which this detail is taken.\n4.  **Artistic Style and Medium:** The style of the figures, the composition, and the decorative garland frame are hallmarks of the Della Robbia family workshop, which specialized in glazed terracotta sculptures in 15th and 16th century Florence. The smooth, refined modeling is typical of their work.\n5.  **Attribution:** Based on the style, subject, and inscription, the work can be identified as a detail from the predella of the *Altarpiece of the Seven Sacraments*. This altarpiece is located in the Church of San Martino a Gangalandi in Lastra a Signa, near Florence. While the overall project came from the workshop of Andrea della Robbia, the execution of the predella panels, including this tondo of the Eucharist, is widely attributed by art historians to his son, **Giovanni della Robbia**. Giovanni continued the family workshop and developed his own distinct, slightly more narrative style.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe artwork is a detail from the *Altarpiece of the Seven Sacraments*. While it is a product of the Della Robbia workshop, the specific artist credited with creating this section is Giovanni della Robbia.\n\n<<<Giovanni della Robbia>>>"
