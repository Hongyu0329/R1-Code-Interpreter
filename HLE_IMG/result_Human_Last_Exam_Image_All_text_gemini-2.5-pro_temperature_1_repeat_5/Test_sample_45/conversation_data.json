    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Concept of Rotational Symmetry**\nRotational symmetry describes how many times a figure or pattern matches itself when rotated in a full 360-degree turn around a central point. If a pattern matches itself 'n' times, it is said to have n-fold rotational symmetry. The angle of each rotation is 360/n degrees.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Basic Shapes in the Tiling**\nThe tiling is a repeating pattern composed of three different geometric shapes (tiles):\n1.  **Regular Hexagons:** These are the large, dark blue tiles.\n2.  **Squares:** These are the light yellow tiles.\n3.  **Rhombi:** These are the smaller, orange, diamond-shaped tiles.\n\n**Step 3: Locate Potential Centers of Rotation**\nThe centers of rotation in a tiling are typically located at high-symmetry points, such as the center of a tile or a vertex where multiple tiles meet. Let's examine the centers of the different tiles.\n\n**Step 4: Test the Center of a Hexagon**\n*   **Focus:** Pick one of the central blue hexagons and consider its center point.\n*   **Action:** Imagine rotating the entire tiling pattern around this point.\n*   **Observation:** A regular hexagon has 6 sides of equal length. If we rotate the pattern by 60 degrees (360°/6), the central hexagon rotates onto its original footprint. Crucially, we must check if the surrounding pattern also aligns. Each hexagon is surrounded by a ring of six squares and six rhombi. A 60-degree rotation maps each of these surrounding squares and rhombi perfectly onto the position of its neighbor. The entire tiling pattern remains unchanged.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the pattern matches itself after a 60-degree rotation, the center of the hexagon is a point of **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n**Step 5: Test the Center of a Square (for completeness)**\n*   **Focus:** Pick one of the light yellow squares and consider its center point.\n*   **Action:** Imagine rotating the entire tiling pattern around this point.\n*   **Observation:** A square has 4-fold symmetry. If we rotate the pattern by 90 degrees (360°/4) around the center of a square, the square itself aligns. The four hexagons and four rhombi surrounding the square also map onto their neighbors. The entire pattern looks the same.\n*   **Conclusion:** The center of each square is a point of **4-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n**Step 6: Identify the Highest Order of Rotational Symmetry**\nThe tiling possesses multiple centers of rotation with different orders (including 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold). When asked for \"the\" rotational symmetry of a pattern, the convention is to state the highest order of rotational symmetry that exists anywhere in the pattern.\n\n*   We found centers of 6-fold rotation.\n*   We found centers of 4-fold rotation.\n*   The highest order of rotation is 6.\n\nTherefore, the rotational symmetry of the tiling is 6-fold.\n\n<<<6>>>"
