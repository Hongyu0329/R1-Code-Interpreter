    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to determine the duration, in seconds, of the longest R-R interval shown on the provided ECG rhythm strip. The R-R interval is the time between two consecutive R waves (the tall, sharp peaks of the QRS complex).\n\n2.  **Determine ECG Calibration:** The ECG strip provides the calibration settings in the top left corner:\n    *   **Paper Speed:** 25 mm/sec. This is the crucial piece of information for time calculations.\n    *   **Voltage/Amplitude:** 1 cm/mV. This is not needed for measuring time intervals.\n\n3.  **Calculate Time per Grid Square:** Based on the paper speed of 25 mm/sec:\n    *   The standard ECG grid has small squares of 1 mm and large squares of 5 mm.\n    *   Time for one small square (1 mm) = 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n    *   Time for one large square (5 mm) = 5 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.2 seconds.\n\n4.  **Locate the Longest R-R Interval:**\n    *   Visually inspect the entire ECG strip, which displays several rows of Lead II rhythm.\n    *   Most of the R-R intervals appear to be regular and relatively short.\n    *   A prominent pause is visible in the fourth row of the tracing, starting after the fourth QRS complex in that row. This gap is visibly longer than any other R-R interval on the strip.\n\n5.  **Measure the Longest Interval:**\n    *   Focus on the identified longest R-R interval in the fourth row.\n    *   Measure the distance between the peak of the R wave just before the pause and the peak of the R wave just after the pause by counting the number of large grid squares.\n    *   Counting the squares reveals that the interval spans exactly **8 large squares**.\n\n6.  **Convert the Measurement to Seconds:**\n    *   Using the conversion factor from Step 3, multiply the number of large squares by the time per large square.\n    *   Calculation: 8 large squares Ã— 0.2 seconds/large square = 1.6 seconds.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Correctly reading the paper speed:** The speed is clearly marked as 25 mm/sec. Using the wrong speed (e.g., 50 mm/sec) would lead to an incorrect answer.\n*   **Accurate counting of squares:** It's important to carefully count the squares from the peak of one R wave to the peak of the next. In this case, the peaks align well with the grid lines, making the count of 8 large squares straightforward.\n*   **Scanning the entire strip:** Do not just measure the first interval you see. A thorough scan is necessary to ensure you have found the absolute longest interval, especially in a rhythm that shows variability. The pause identified is clearly an anomaly compared to the underlying rhythm, making it the longest interval.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe longest R-R interval on the ECG strip measures 8 large squares. With a paper speed of 25 mm/sec, this corresponds to a time of 1.6 seconds.\n\n<<<1.6>>>"
