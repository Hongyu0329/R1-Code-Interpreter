    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the characters on the seal:\n\n1.  **Determine the Reading Order:** Traditional Chinese seals are read from top to bottom, and the columns are read from right to left. This seal has three columns with two characters in each column.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Rightmost Column:**\n    *   **Top Character:** This is the ancient seal script for **壽 (shòu)**, which means \"longevity\".\n    *   **Bottom Character:** This is the seal script for **比 (bǐ)**, which means \"to compare with\" or \"like\".\n    *   This column reads **壽比 (shòu bǐ)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Middle Column:**\n    *   **Top Character:** This is the seal script for **南 (nán)**, meaning \"south\".\n    *   **Bottom Character:** This is a clear pictograph of mountain peaks, which is the character **山 (shān)**, meaning \"mountain\".\n    *   This column reads **南山 (nán shān)**.\n    *   Combining the first two columns, we get the well-known auspicious phrase **壽比南山 (shòu bǐ nán shān)**, which translates to \"May your longevity be as great as the Southern Mountains.\"\n\n4.  **Analyze the Leftmost Column:**\n    *   **Top Character:** This character has the \"spirit/altar\" radical (示) on the left, which is characteristic of the character **福 (fú)**, meaning \"blessing\" or \"good fortune\".\n    *   **Bottom Character:** This character is composed of two parts, a left and a right. It corresponds to the seal script for **如 (rú)**, which means \"as\" or \"like\".\n    *   This column reads **福如 (fú rú)**.\n\n5.  **Combine All Characters and Interpret:**\n    *   Reading all columns from right to left, the characters are **壽比南山福如 (shòu bǐ nán shān fú rú)**.\n    *   This combines two famous wishes: \"壽比南山\" (Longevity like the Southern Mountains) and the beginning of \"福如東海\" (fú rú dōng hǎi - Blessings like the Eastern Sea). It is common for seals to use parts of well-known phrases due to space limitations, with the rest of the phrase being implied.\n\n6.  **Convert to Simplified Chinese:**\n    *   壽 becomes **寿**.\n    *   比, 南, 山, 福, 如 remain the same in simplified Chinese.\n\nTherefore, the full content on the seal in simplified Chinese is \"寿比南山福如\".\n\n<<<寿比南山福如>>>"
