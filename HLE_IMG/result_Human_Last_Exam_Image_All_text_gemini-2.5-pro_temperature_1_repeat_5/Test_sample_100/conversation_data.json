    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and determine its molecular formula.**\n\nThe starting material is a complex bicyclic molecule. Let's break it down to determine its composition. The structure is a derivative of a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptenone, commonly known as a Vince lactam. This assignment is based on the N-C=O connectivity, indicating a lactam (cyclic amide).\n\n*   **Core Structure (2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one):**\n    *   The bicyclo[2.2.1] system has 7 atoms in its framework.\n    *   C1 (bridgehead): 1 C, 1 H\n    *   N2 (aza group): 1 N\n    *   C3 (carbonyl group): 1 C, 1 O\n    *   C4 (bridgehead): 1 C, 1 H\n    *   C5 (alkene carbon with CF3): 1 C\n    *   C6 (alkene carbon): 1 C, 1 H\n    *   C7 (methylene bridge): 1 C, 2 H\n    *   Total for the unsubstituted core: C6H5NO.\n\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   **CF3 (trifluoromethyl) group:** Attached to C5. Formula: CF3. This adds 1 C and 3 F.\n    *   **PMB (para-methoxybenzyl) group:** Attached to the nitrogen (N2). The formula for a PMB group (-CH2-C6H4-OCH3) is C8H9O.\n\n*   **Total Molecular Formula of Starting Material:**\n    *   Add the atoms from the core and substituents:\n    *   Carbons: 6 (core) + 1 (CF3) + 8 (PMB) = 15 C\n    *   Hydrogens: 5 (core) + 9 (PMB) = 14 H\n    *   Fluorines: 3 F\n    *   Nitrogens: 1 N\n    *   Oxygens: 1 (core carbonyl) + 1 (PMB ether) = 2 O\n    *   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first reaction to find the formula of Intermediate 1.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   **Reaction:** CAN is a standard reagent for the oxidative deprotection of PMB protecting groups on amines and alcohols. The PMB group is removed from the nitrogen atom and replaced with a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Change in Formula:**\n    *   Remove the PMB group: -C8H9O.\n    *   Add a hydrogen atom to the nitrogen: +H.\n    *   Net change: -C8H8O.\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 1:**\n    *   C(15-8) H(14-9+1) F3 N O(2-1) = **C7H6F3NO**.\n    *   Intermediate 1 is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second reaction to find the formula of Intermediate 2.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H2 in MeOH.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. It will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond (C5=C6) to a single bond. Ketones are generally not reduced under these mild conditions.\n*   **Change in Formula:**\n    *   Addition of one molecule of hydrogen (H2) across the double bond.\n    *   Net change: +2H.\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 2:**\n    *   C7 H(6+2) F3NO = **C7H8F3NO**.\n    *   Intermediate 2 is the saturated lactam, 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third reaction to find the formula of the final Product.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C.\n*   **Reaction:** These are conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an amide (or in this case, a lactam). The amide bond (N2-C3) is cleaved by the addition of one molecule of water (H2O). This opens the bicyclic ring system to form an amino acid derivative.\n*   **Change in Formula:**\n    *   Addition of one molecule of water (H2O).\n    *   Net change: +H2O.\n*   **Formula of the Final Product:**\n    *   C7 H(8+2) F3 N O(1+1) = **C7H10F3NO2**.\n    *   The product is a substituted cyclopentane amino acid. Counting the atoms in the resulting structure confirms this formula.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation Summary:**\n*   Starting Material: C15H14F3NO2\n*   After Step 1 (-C8H8O): C7H6F3NO\n*   After Step 2 (+H2): C7H8F3NO\n*   After Step 3 (+H2O): C7H10F3NO2\n\nThe molecular formula of the final product is C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
