A: A complex rearranged adduct formed from the starting material and two molecules of methyl propiolate, with the elimination of CO2 and ketene. A possible structure is a pyrido[1,2-c]pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrimidine derivative.
B: A tricyclic lactone resulting from the [8π+2π] cycloaddition of the enamine tautomer of the starting material with methyl propiolate, followed by intramolecular lactonization and elimination of methanol.
C: The N-acetyl derivative of the enamine tautomer of the starting material, formed by acylation of the enamine's secondary nitrogen by acetic anhydride.

Here are the proposed structures:
