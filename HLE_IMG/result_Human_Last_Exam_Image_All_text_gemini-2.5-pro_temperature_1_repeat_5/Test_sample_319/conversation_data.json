    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual information provided.**\n    The image consists of two plots.\n    1.  The top plot is a spectrogram, which displays the frequency content of a sound over time. We can see a single horizontal line, representing a pure tone of a constant frequency. This line is interrupted by a vertical band of blue, which represents a short burst of sound containing a wide range of frequencies (i.e., noise). After the noise burst, the plot shows two horizontal lines. One is at the same frequency as the original tone, and a new one appears at a different frequency.\n    2.  The bottom plot shows the corresponding waveform of the sound. It begins as a simple, regular sine wave (a pure tone). It then becomes a very complex, non-periodic wave (the noise burst). Finally, it settles into a more complex but still periodic wave, which is the result of adding two sine waves together (a two-tone chord).\n\n*   **Step 2: Interpret the sound stimulus.**\n    Based on the plots, the stimulus is a sequence of three sounds:\n    1.  A pure tone.\n    2.  A burst of noise that completely masks/replaces the tone.\n    3.  A chord consisting of two pure tones, one of which is the same as the original tone.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the textual clues in the question.**\n    1.  **\"Illusion\":** This indicates that what is perceived is different from the physical reality of the stimulus. In reality, the first tone stops, there's noise, and then a two-tone chord begins. The illusion is in how the brain interprets this sequence.\n    2.  **\"similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity\":** The Necker Cube is an ambiguous figure that can be perceived in two different stable orientations. This suggests the auditory illusion also has (at least) two possible interpretations.\n        *   Interpretation A (veridical): A tone plays, then stops. Noise plays. Then a new sound (a two-tone chord) begins.\n        *   Interpretation B (illusory): A tone plays and *continues* through the noise. A second tone is added after the noise.\n    3.  **\"reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\":** This points to a fundamental process of the brain. The brain's tendency is to choose Interpretation B. It \"fills in\" the missing part of the tone during the noise, perceiving it as continuous. This is based on the principle of good continuation, a Gestalt principle of perception. The brain assumes that a sound source doesn't just vanish and reappear; it's more likely that it was simply occluded or masked by another sound (the noise). This is a vital ability for understanding sounds in noisy, everyday environments (e.g., understanding speech when a door slams).\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the name of the phenomenon.**\n    The phenomenon where a sound is perceived as continuing through an interrupting, masking sound is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**. It is a classic example of auditory scene analysis, demonstrating the brain's ability to perceptually restore missing auditory information. When this effect occurs with speech sounds (e.g., a missing letter in a word is replaced by a cough), it is called the phonemic restoration effect, which is a specific type of the more general Auditory Continuity Illusion. The stimulus shown in the image is the canonical example used to demonstrate this illusion with tones.\n\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion>>>"
