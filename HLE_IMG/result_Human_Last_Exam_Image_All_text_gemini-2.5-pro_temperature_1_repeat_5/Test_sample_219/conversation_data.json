    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph**\nThe provided image is a raster plot showing the firing activity of neurons recorded by 128 electrodes over time.\n*   The **y-axis** represents the electrode number (from 0 to 128).\n*   The **x-axis** represents time in seconds (s), from 0 to 50.\n*   Each black dot indicates a neuronal firing (an action potential or \"spike\") detected by a specific electrode at a specific time.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synchronized Bursts**\nA \"synchronized burst\" is a period where a large number of neurons fire intensely and at roughly the same time. Visually, these appear as dense vertical bands of dots spanning many electrodes. We need to identify the timestamps of these events. Let's estimate the center time for each major burst.\n*   **Burst 1:** The first prominent vertical band is centered at approximately **t₁ = 3 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** The second clear vertical band is centered at approximately **t₂ = 15 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** The third, slightly more diffuse but still synchronized event, is centered at approximately **t₃ = 27 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** The fourth, very dense burst is centered at approximately **t₄ = 37 s**.\n*   **Burst 5:** The fifth and final major burst within the 50-second window is centered at approximately **t₅ = 48 s**.\nThe identified timestamps are: 3 s, 15 s, 27 s, 37 s, and 48 s.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time difference between the start (or midpoint) of consecutive bursts. Using the timestamps identified above, we can calculate the four intervals.\n*   **Interval 1:** t₂ - t₁ = 15 s - 3 s = 12 s\n*   **Interval 2:** t₃ - t₂ = 27 s - 15 s = 12 s\n*   **Interval 3:** t₄ - t₃ = 37 s - 27 s = 10 s\n*   **Interval 4:** t₅ - t₄ = 48 s - 37 s = 11 s\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual intervals and divide by the number of intervals.\n*   **Sum of intervals:** 12 s + 12 s + 10 s + 11 s = 45 s\n*   **Number of intervals:** 4\n*   **Average IBI:** 45 s / 4 = 11.25 s\n\n**Step 5: Round to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question asks for the final answer to be rounded to two significant figures.\n*   The calculated average is 11.25 s.\n*   The first two significant figures are 1 and 1. The third digit is 2.\n*   Since 2 is less than 5, we round down.\n*   The average inter-burst interval is **11 s**.\n\n<<<11>>>"
