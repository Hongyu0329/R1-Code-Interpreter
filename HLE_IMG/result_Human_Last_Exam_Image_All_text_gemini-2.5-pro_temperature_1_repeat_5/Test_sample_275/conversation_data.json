    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to identify and count all the unique splice species (different mRNA molecules resulting from splicing) based on the provided RT-PCR data.\n\n2.  **Understanding the experiment:** The image shows results from Reverse Transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). This technique detects and amplifies specific RNA transcripts. Different bands on the gel represent different sized PCR products.\n    *   **Panel A:** A map of the viral genome showing gene locations (E1, E2, L1, etc.), primer binding sites (E1F1, E4R, etc.), and polyadenylation signals (AE for early transcripts, AL for late transcripts).\n    *   **Panels B-I:** Gel electrophoresis results for different primer pairs. Multiple bands in a single lane (for a given primer pair) indicate multiple splice species.\n\n3.  **Analyzing each panel for evidence of splice species:**\n\n    *   **Panel B (Primers: E1F1/E4R):** This reaction amplifies transcripts containing sequences from the E1 and E4 regions. There are two distinct bands (band 1: 190 bp; band 2: 159 bp). This indicates the existence of **2 different splice species** in this region. Let's call them Species 1 and Species 2.\n\n    *   **Panel C (Primers: E1F1/E5R):** This reaction uses the same forward primer as B but a reverse primer further downstream (in E5). It also shows two bands (band 1: 584 bp; band 2: 553 bp). The size difference between the bands is 31 bp, the same as in Panel B. This confirms the existence of Species 1 and 2 and shows they both extend to the E5 region. It does not identify any new species.\n\n    *   **Panel D (Primers: E1F2/E5R):** This is a key panel. The forward primer, E1F2, is specifically designed to span the 929^3465 splice junction. Therefore, it only amplifies transcripts that have undergone this specific splicing event. The single band (551 bp) represents a **1 new splice species** (Species 3) that is distinct from Species 1 and 2 due to its specific splice site.\n\n    *   **Panel F (Primers: E1F2/L2R):** This uses the same specific forward primer E1F2 but a reverse primer in L2. The single band (972 bp) confirms that Species 3 extends to the L2 region. No new species are identified.\n\n    *   **Panel G (Primers: E1F3/L2R):** This is another key panel. The forward primer, E1F3, is specific for a different splice junction (929^3506). The presence of two bands (band 1: 1,003 bp; band 2: 931 bp) indicates there are **2 new splice species** (Species 4 and 5). Both share the 929^3506 splice but differ in another splicing event downstream, causing the size difference.\n\n    *   **Panel H (Primers: E1F1/L1R, 20 cycles):** This primer pair is designed to detect transcripts where the early region (E1) is spliced to the late region (L1), bypassing the early polyadenylation site (AE). Two bands are visible (band 1: 450 bp; band 2: 419 bp). These represent **2 new splice species** (Species 6 and 7), which are \"late\" transcripts, distinct from the \"early\" transcripts identified in panels B-G.\n\n    *   **Panel I (Primers: E1F1/L1R, 30 cycles):** This is the same reaction as Panel H but run for more cycles to increase sensitivity. Four bands are now visible: 450, 419, 378, and 187 bp.\n        *   The 450 bp and 419 bp bands confirm Species 6 and 7.\n        *   The 378 bp band represents **1 new splice species** (Species 8).\n        *   The 187 bp band represents **1 new splice species** (Species 9).\n        These are less abundant late transcripts that become visible with more amplification.\n\n4.  **Consolidating and counting all unique species:**\n\n    *   From Panel B: 2 species\n    *   From Panel D: 1 new species\n    *   From Panel G: 2 new species\n    *   From Panel I: 4 species in total (2 of which were seen in H, and 2 more are newly revealed). These 4 are distinct from all the species in B, D, and G because they are late transcripts (E1 spliced to L1).\n\n    Total count = 2 (from B) + 1 (from D) + 2 (from G) + 4 (from I) = 9.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy systematically analyzing each RT-PCR result and considering the specificity of the primers used, we can identify a total of 9 distinct splice species.\n\n*   2 early species detected by E1F1/E4R.\n*   1 early species defined by the 929^3465 splice.\n*   2 early species defined by the 929^3506 splice.\n*   4 late species resulting from splicing E1 to L1.\n\n<<<9>>>"
