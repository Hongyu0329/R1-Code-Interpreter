The structures of the two major products, A and B, are as follows:

**Compound A:**
```
      O
     //
Ph-CH-C-Ph
  |
  CH₂-O-C(CH₃)₃
```
which is **1-benzoyloxy-2-tert-butoxy-1-phenylethane**.

**Compound B:**
```
Ph-CH=CH-O-C(CH₃)₃
```
which is **1-tert-butoxy-2-phenylethene** (a mixture of E/Z isomers is possible).

Here are the structures drawn out:
