    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the reactants, product, and reaction conditions.**\n    *   **Reactants:** The reactants are hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆) and cyclobutene (C₄H₄). Hexafluorobenzene is an aromatic compound with a 6π-electron system. Cyclobutene is a cyclic alkene with a 2π-electron system.\n    *   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions, indicated by `hv`. This means the reaction pathway must involve steps that are allowed by the rules of photochemistry (Woodward-Hoffmann rules).\n    *   **Product:** The product is a complex, non-aromatic, tricyclic molecule. The formation of such a structure from an aromatic ring and an alkene suggests that significant bond reorganization has occurred.\n    *   **Stoichiometry Check:** A key point of careful analysis is to check the atom balance. The reactants (C₆F₆ + C₄H₄) have a total of 10 carbon atoms, 6 fluorine atoms, and 4 hydrogen atoms (C₁₀H₄F₆). The product, as drawn, is a derivative of tricyclo[4.2.0.0²,⁵]octane, which has an 8-carbon skeleton. The substituents shown are 6 fluorine atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms. Thus, the drawn product has the formula C₈H₄F₆. There is a discrepancy of two carbon atoms between the reactants and the product. This is likely an error in the provided image. However, the question asks for the *types* of reactions involved in the transformation. We can deduce these by considering the most plausible photochemical reactions of the given starting materials, even if the final product drawing is not perfectly accurate.\n\n*   **Step 2: Propose a plausible multi-step mechanism involving pericyclic reactions.**\n    The problem states that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur. This strongly implies a sequential process.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the first pericyclic reaction.**\n    *   Hexafluorobenzene is an aromatic 6π system. A common and well-documented photochemical reaction of benzene derivatives is the valence isomerization to their corresponding Dewar benzene isomers.\n    *   This transformation, from benzene to Dewar benzene (bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene), is classified as a **[6π] electrocyclic reaction**.\n    *   According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, for a 6π electron system (a 4n+2 system where n=1), the electrocyclization is photochemically allowed if it proceeds with disrotatory stereochemistry. This is a known, allowed process.\n    *   So, the first reaction is: Hexafluorobenzene → Hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene. This is a **[6π] electrocyclization**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the second pericyclic reaction.**\n    *   The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, is a strained molecule containing two reactive C=C double bonds (2π systems). The other reactant is cyclobutene, which also has a C=C double bond (a 2π system).\n    *   A reaction between two alkene systems to form a cyclobutane ring is a cycloaddition reaction. Since each component contributes 2π electrons, this is a **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n    *   According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, for a [2+2] cycloaddition (a 4π electron process, or 4n where n=1), the reaction is photochemically allowed if it proceeds with a suprafacial-suprafacial geometry. This is also a very common and well-known photochemical reaction.\n    *   So, the second reaction is: Hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene + Cyclobutene → Final Product. This is a **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the types of reactions.**\n    *   The overall transformation can be explained by a sequence of two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions.\n    1.  A **[6π] electrocyclic reaction** (valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene).\n    2.  A **[2+2] cycloaddition** (reaction of the resulting Dewar benzene with cyclobutene).\n    *   This mechanism explains the loss of aromaticity and the formation of a complex polycyclic system with new four-membered rings, which is consistent with the general features of the transformation shown, despite the error in the atom count of the product structure.\n\n<<<A [6π] electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition>>>"
