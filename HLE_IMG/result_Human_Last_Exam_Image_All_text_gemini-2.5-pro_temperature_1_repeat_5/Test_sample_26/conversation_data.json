    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the harmony in measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n1.  **Locate the Measure and Identify the Key:**\n    *   The question asks for the analysis of measure 30. Looking at the score, the second system starts on measure 28. Therefore, measure 30 is the third measure of the second system, which is the measure circled in the provided image.\n    *   The key signature at the beginning of the movement is three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). The piece is in C minor.\n\n2.  **Identify the Notes in Measure 30:**\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The left hand plays an octave on G (G2 and G3) on the first beat and holds it throughout the measure.\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The right hand plays a repeating sixteenth-note arpeggio. We need to identify the pitches, taking into account the key signature and any accidentals. The notes are:\n        *   G4 (on the second line of the staff).\n        *   B♮4 (on the third line, with a natural sign cancelling the B♭ of the key signature).\n        *   D5 (on the fourth line).\n        *   F♯5 (on the top line, with a sharp sign).\n    *   **Combined Pitches:** The complete set of pitches sounding in this measure is G, B♮, D, and F♯.\n\n3.  **Determine the Chord Identity:**\n    *   To identify the chord, we stack the pitches into thirds, starting from the bass note, G.\n    *   The notes are G (root), B♮ (a major third above G), D (a perfect fifth above G), and F♯ (a major seventh above G).\n    *   These notes form a **G major seventh chord**, which is often abbreviated as Gmaj7 or GM7.\n\n4.  **Perform Roman Numeral Analysis:**\n    *   Roman numeral analysis relates the chord to the home key, which is C minor.\n    *   The root of the chord is G. In the key of C minor, G is the fifth scale degree (the dominant). Therefore, the Roman numeral will be based on **V**.\n    *   In a minor key, the dominant chord is typically major to create a strong pull to the tonic. This is achieved by raising the seventh scale degree (the leading tone). In C minor, the leading tone is B♮. Our chord contains G-B♮-D, which is a G major triad. This confirms the use of an uppercase Roman numeral: **V**.\n    *   The chord also contains a seventh. The seventh is F♯, which is a *major* seventh above the root G. A standard dominant seventh chord (V7) in C minor would have a *minor* seventh (F♮).\n    *   The presence of the major seventh (F♯) is a highly expressive chromatic alteration. To represent this accurately in Roman numeral analysis, we must specify the quality of the seventh.\n    *   The complete and most accurate Roman numeral for a major seventh chord built on the dominant is **Vmaj7** or **V M7**.\n\n5.  **Consider the Harmonic Context (Careful Points):**\n    *   The preceding measure (m. 29) contains an F♯ diminished seventh chord (F♯-A-C-E♭) over a G pedal point. This chord is the leading-tone seventh chord to G (vii°7/V), which strongly prepares the arrival of the dominant (V) chord.\n    *   The F♯ from the vii°7/V in m. 29 is carried over into the V chord in m. 30, creating the intensely dissonant and dramatic Vmaj7 sonority.\n    *   This chord does not resolve immediately in a standard way but leads to a C minor seventh chord in m. 31, followed by a pause and further transitional material before the main theme returns. Despite the delayed resolution, its function within this passage is unequivocally dominant.\n    *   While a simpler analysis might just label the chord as \"V\" to indicate its function, this would ignore the most striking and unusual note (the F♯). The most correct and descriptive analysis includes the quality of the seventh.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chord in measure 30 consists of the notes G, B♮, D, and F♯, which form a G major seventh chord. In the key of C minor, this is a major seventh chord built on the dominant.\n\n<<<Vmaj7>>>"
