    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the plant in the image.**\nThe image displays a plant with very characteristic leaves. The key features are:\n*   Dark green, oblong to elliptical leaves.\n*   A striking and prominent network of pale green or white veins, a pattern known as reticulate venation.\n*   The leaves are arranged in a whorled or opposite pattern on the stems.\n*   The overall appearance is that of a shrub.\nBased on these features, the plant can be identified as *Debregeasia healeana*. This ornamental shrub is well-known for its unique and beautiful foliage.\n\n**Step 2: Research the origin and endemic range of *Debregeasia healeana*.**\nNow that the plant is identified, the next step is to find out where it originated. The question asks specifically for the island to which it **was** endemic. The use of the past tense \"was\" is a clue that its status in the wild may have changed (e.g., it might be extinct in the wild or its exact native range was only recently confirmed).\n*   A search for the origin of *Debregeasia healeana* reveals a fascinating history. For a long time, its origin was a mystery after it was introduced to cultivation in Europe in the 19th century.\n*   Botanical records show it was collected by Charles Moore, the then-director of the Sydney Botanic Gardens, during an expedition in the 1850s.\n*   The location of this collection, and the place where the plant is considered to be endemic, is the island of **Aneityum** (also known as **Anatom**).\n\n**Step 3: Locate the island.**\nAneityum (Anatom) is the southernmost inhabited island in the nation of Vanuatu (formerly known as the New Hebrides) in the South Pacific Ocean.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the answer.**\nBased on the identification of the plant as *Debregeasia healeana* and the historical botanical records, the island to which this plant was endemic is Aneityum (Anatom).\n\n<<<Aneityum>>>"
