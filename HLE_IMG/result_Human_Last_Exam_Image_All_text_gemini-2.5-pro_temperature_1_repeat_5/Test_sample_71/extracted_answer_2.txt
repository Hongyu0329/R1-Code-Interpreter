The answer is a chemical structure. Compound A is tris(2-methoxyphenyl)methanol. It has a central carbon atom bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH) and three 2-methoxyphenyl groups.
The structure can be represented by the SMILES string C1=CC=C(C(=C1)OC)C(C2=CC=CC=C2OC)(C3=CC=CC=C3OC)O.
Visually, it is a central carbon atom with four substituents: one -OH group, and three phenyl rings, each of which has a -OCH3 group at the ortho position relative to the central carbon.
