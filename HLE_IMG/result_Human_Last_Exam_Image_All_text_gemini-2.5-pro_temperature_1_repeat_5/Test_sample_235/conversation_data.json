    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the metric pattern of the erasure poem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the complete text of the poem.**\nThe artwork is a collage, a form of erasure poetry where words are selected from a source text and rearranged. To analyze its meter, we must first determine which words constitute the poem. The image contains several textual elements:\n*   The title at the top: \"THE FIRST STEP\"\n*   A number at the top right: \"35\"\n*   A plate number: \"Pl. 4\"\n*   Pasted words forming the body of the poem: \"rules\", \"and\", \"lines,\", \"an intricate spider's web\", \"work\"\n*   Faint cursive text at the bottom, which is part of the original page's background and not the collage itself.\n\nA common practice in such art is to incorporate prominent elements of the original page. The title and the page number are clearly visible and positioned as part of the overall composition. The plate number (\"Pl. 4\") is a publishing detail and less likely to be part of the poem's content. Therefore, the most plausible reading of the full poem combines the title, the number, and the pasted words in a top-to-bottom order.\n\nThis gives us the following line/sentence:\n\"The first step, thirty-five, rules and lines, an intricate spider's web, work.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the metrical options.**\nWe will now evaluate the given answer choices against the text we've identified.\n\n*   **A. free verse:** This means the poem has no regular meter or rhyme scheme. This is a possibility if no other pattern fits.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter:** This form consists of a line with 10 syllables in an unstressed-stressed (da-DUM) pattern.\n*   **C. alexandrine:** This is a line of 12 syllables, typically iambic.\n*   **D. sapphic:** This refers to a specific stanza form, with the most common line (the hendecasyllable) having 11 syllables in a complex trochaic and dactylic pattern.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** This is a line with about 6 syllables and three stressed beats, in a roughly iambic pattern.\n*   **F. american sentence:** This is a form invented by poet Allen Ginsberg, defined as a single sentence that is exactly 17 syllables long.\n\n**Step 3: Count the syllables of the poem.**\nLet's count the syllables in our constructed sentence: \"The first step, thirty-five, rules and lines, an intricate spider's web, work.\"\n\n*   \"The first step\" = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 syllables\n*   \"thirty-five\" = thir-ty-five = 3 syllables\n*   \"rules\" = 1 syllable\n*   \"and\" = 1 syllable\n*   \"lines\" = 1 syllable\n*   \"an\" = 1 syllable\n*   \"in-tri-cate\" = 3 syllables\n*   \"spi-der's\" = 2 syllables\n*   \"web\" = 1 syllable\n*   \"work\" = 1 syllable\n\nTotal syllables = 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = **17 syllables**.\n\n**Step 4: Match the syllable count and form to the options.**\nThe poem forms a single sentence and has exactly 17 syllables. This precisely matches the definition of an **American sentence**.\n\n*   The syllable count (17) does not match iambic pentameter (10), alexandrine (12), sapphic hendecasyllable (11), or iambic trimeter (~6).\n*   While the poem could be loosely described as free verse, the fact that it fits the highly specific 17-syllable rule of the American sentence makes that a more precise and accurate classification.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe careful analysis reveals that by including all the intended textual elements (title, number, and pasted words), the poem forms a single 17-syllable sentence. This structure corresponds to the poetic form known as the American sentence.\n\n<<<F>>>"
