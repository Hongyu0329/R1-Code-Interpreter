    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the word in the image:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Script:** The handwriting is a form of Greek minuscule cursive, typical of the Byzantine era. Letters are often connected (ligatured), and their forms can differ from modern printed versions.\n\n2.  **Identify Letters Sequentially:** We will identify each character from left to right.\n    *   **First Letter:** This is a cursive **μ (mu)**. It has the characteristic initial downstroke followed by two arches.\n    *   **Second Letter:** This is a **θ (theta)**. It is formed as a loop with a clear horizontal stroke across the middle, and it is connected to the preceding mu.\n    *   **Third Letter:** This is a clear cursive **α (alpha)**.\n    *   **Fourth Letter:** This is a **λ (lambda)**, identified by its height and shape.\n    *   **Fifth Letter:** This letter is more complex due to its cursive form and connection to the letters around it. It is not an alpha. It is a cursive **μ (mu)**. In many cursive hands, mu can be written in this more compressed, looped fashion, especially between other letters.\n    *   **Sixth/Seventh Letters:** The character resembling an infinity symbol (∞) is a standard Byzantine ligature for the diphthong **ου (omicron-upsilon)**.\n    *   **Eighth Letter:** The final character is a cursive **ν (nu)**.\n\n3.  **Identify Diacritics (Accents):** There is a curved mark placed over the 'ου' ligature. This mark (a short arc, concave up) is a common form of the **circumflex accent (περισπωμένη)** in Byzantine manuscripts.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Transcription:** Combining the identified letters and the accent, the word as written is: **μθαλμοῦν**.\n\n5.  **Interpret the Word:**\n    *   The word **μθαλμοῦν** is not a standard Ancient or Byzantine Greek word found in dictionaries.\n    *   However, the prompt states it is a form of a *common* Ancient Greek word. The transcribed word strongly resembles **ὀφθαλμῶν** (ophthalmôn), which is the genitive plural of the very common word ὀφθαλμός (ophthalmos), meaning \"eye\". The form ὀφθαλμῶν means \"of the eyes\".\n    *   The transcription μθαλμοῦν can be explained as a scribal variant or error for ὀφθαλμῶν:\n        *   **μθ- for ὀφθ-**: The initial **ὀφ-** (oph-) may have been corrupted or simplified. The scribe might have miswritten the initial omicron with a breathing mark as a mu, and simplified the consonant cluster 'φθ' (phth) to 'θ' (th).\n        *   **-μοῦν for -μῶν**: In later Greek, the pronunciation of the long vowel **ω (ō)** and the diphthong **ου (ou)** merged to /u/. Scribes frequently used 'ου' and 'ω' interchangeably based on pronunciation. Therefore, the genitive plural ending **-ῶν** is often written as **-οῦν**. The circumflex accent is correctly placed on this final syllable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe text in the manuscript literally says **μθαλμοῦν**. This is a non-standard Byzantine spelling of the common Greek word **ὀφθαλμῶν**, meaning \"of the eyes\". The question asks \"What does it say?\", which calls for a direct transcription of the written form.\n\n<<<μθαλμοῦν>>>"
