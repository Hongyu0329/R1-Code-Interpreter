The main difference in the sporophyte that helps distinguish *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the shape of the seta (the stalk holding the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight, causing the capsule to be erect and immersed within the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a distinctly curved or swan-necked (cygneous) seta, which causes its capsule to be exserted and to hang or nod downwards.
