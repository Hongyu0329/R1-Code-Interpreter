    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n*   The mass spectrum shows the molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 135. This means the molecular weight (MW) of the compound is 135 u.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule**: An odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. We will assume one nitrogen atom (N, atomic weight ≈ 14 u).\n*   **Molecular Formula Calculation**:\n    *   Mass of non-nitrogen atoms = 135 - 14 = 121 u.\n    *   Dividing by the mass of carbon (12 u): 121 / 12 ≈ 10. This suggests around 9 or 10 carbons.\n    *   Let's try the formula C₉H₁₃N.\n    *   MW of C₉H₁₃N = (9 × 12.01) + (13 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) = 108.09 + 13.13 + 14.01 = 135.23 u. This matches the M⁺ peak.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**:\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4.\n    *   A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring (1 ring + 3 double bonds).\n\n**Step 2: Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **~3030 cm⁻¹**: Peaks above 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretching from sp² hybridized carbons, typical for an aromatic ring.\n*   **~2850-2960 cm⁻¹**: Peaks below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretching from sp³ hybridized carbons, typical for alkyl groups.\n*   **~1600, 1500, 1450 cm⁻¹**: Peaks in this region are due to C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹**: A broadish absorption in this region suggests the presence of an N-H bond, likely from an amine.\n*   **~700-750 cm⁻¹**: Strong peaks in this region (C-H out-of-plane bending) often indicate the substitution pattern of the benzene ring. The pattern is consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**Step 3: ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis**\n*   **¹³C Chemical Shifts (ppm)**: 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. There are 7 distinct carbon signals, while the formula is C₉H₁₃N. This implies some symmetry.\n*   **Aromatic Region (δ > 100 ppm)**: Four signals at 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm. This is consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring (one quaternary ipso-carbon, and three signals for the ortho, meta, and para carbons, assuming ortho and meta pairs are equivalent).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (δ < 100 ppm)**: Three signals at 49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm. These correspond to the three carbons of the C₃H₇ side chain.\n*   **DEPT-135 Data**: This experiment distinguishes carbon types.\n    *   Positive signals: CH and CH₃ groups.\n    *   Negative signals: CH₂ groups.\n    *   Absent signals: Quaternary carbons.\n*   **Analysis of DEPT-135**:\n    *   \"one negative signal\": There is one CH₂ group in the molecule.\n    *   \"five positive signals\": There are a total of five CH and/or CH₃ groups.\n*   **Combining ¹³C and DEPT**:\n    *   The quaternary aromatic carbon (ipso-C) at 145.1 ppm will be absent in DEPT-135.\n    *   The other three aromatic signals (128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm) must be CH groups, accounting for 3 of the 5 positive signals.\n    *   This leaves the three aliphatic carbons. One must be a CH₂ (the negative signal), and the other two must be CH or CH₃ (the remaining 2 positive signals).\n    *   So, the C₃H₇ side chain is composed of one CH₂, one CH, and one CH₃ group. This confirms the side chain is a propyl group arranged as -CH₂-CH-CH₃.\n\n**Step 4: ¹H NMR Analysis**\n*   **~7.2-7.4 ppm (multiplet, 5H integration)**: This signal corresponds to the five protons on a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **~2.9 ppm (multiplet, ~2H integration)**: This signal corresponds to a CH₂ group.\n*   **~2.7 ppm (multiplet, ~1H integration)**: This signal corresponds to a CH group.\n*   **~1.15 ppm (doublet, ~3H integration)**: A doublet with 3H integration is characteristic of a methyl (CH₃) group adjacent to a single proton (a CH group).\n\n**Step 5: HSQC Analysis (Structure Assembly)**\nThe HSQC spectrum correlates each proton signal with the carbon signal it is directly bonded to.\n*   **Aromatic Region**: The proton multiplet at ~7.3 ppm correlates with the carbon signals between 126-129 ppm, confirming the aromatic CH groups.\n*   **Aliphatic Region Cross-Peaks**:\n    1.  The proton signal at **~1.15 ppm (CH₃)** correlates with the carbon signal at **19.2 ppm**.\n    2.  The proton signal at **~2.7 ppm (CH)** correlates with the carbon signal at **49.6 ppm**.\n    3.  The proton signal at **~2.9 ppm (CH₂)** correlates with the carbon signal at **43.5 ppm**.\n\n**Step 6: Final Structure Determination and IUPAC Naming**\nWe need to assemble the fragments: a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), a CH₂, a CH, a CH₃, and an NH₂ group (from the formula C₉H₁₃N and IR data). There are two possible constitutional isomers:\n*   **Isomer A (2-phenylpropan-1-amine)**: C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂\n*   **Isomer B (1-phenylpropan-2-amine)**: C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃\n\nLet's compare the expected ¹³C chemical shifts with our HSQC data:\n*   **Isomer B (1-phenylpropan-2-amine)**:\n    *   **CH₂ group**: It is benzylic (attached to the phenyl ring). Expected δC ≈ 40-45 ppm. Our data shows the CH₂ is at **43.5 ppm**. This is a good match.\n    *   **CH group**: It is attached to the nitrogen atom of the amine group. This is an electron-withdrawing environment. Expected δC ≈ 50-55 ppm. Our data shows the CH is at **49.6 ppm**. This is also a good match.\n*   **Isomer A (2-phenylpropan-1-amine)**:\n    *   **CH group**: It is benzylic. Expected δC ≈ 40-45 ppm. Our data shows the CH is at 49.6 ppm, which is too high.\n    *   **CH₂ group**: It is attached to the nitrogen. Expected δC ≈ 40-50 ppm. Our data shows the CH₂ is at 43.5 ppm, which is plausible but less definitive.\n\nThe data strongly supports **Isomer B**. The benzylic CH₂ is at 43.5 ppm, and the CH-N is at 49.6 ppm.\n\n**IUPAC Name**:\n*   The structure is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n*   **Parent chain**: The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (amine) is a 3-carbon chain (propane).\n*   **Numbering**: Number the chain to give the amine group the lowest possible number.\n    C₆H₅-C¹H₂-C²H(NH₂)-C³H₃\n*   **Suffix**: The amine is on carbon 2, so the parent name is **propan-2-amine**.\n*   **Prefix**: There is a phenyl substituent on carbon 1.\n*   **Full Name**: **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
