The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the V domain of the RAGE receptor. It could be used as a prognostic marker in the pathology of neurological disorders. This is because the protein is not just a bystander but an active participant that, upon binding to RAGE, initiates signaling cascades leading directly to neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. As its levels are over-expressed in these conditions, its concentration likely correlates with the severity and progression of the disease, which is the definition of a prognostic marker.
