    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the substituents at the indicated positions.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reaction**\n*   **Reactant:** The starting material is a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol. Based on its ring structure and methyl group pattern, it belongs to the friedelane family of natural products. Specifically, it is friedelan-3-ol.\n*   **Conditions:** The reaction is carried out with catalytic hydrochloric acid (cat. HCl) at 110 °C. These are typical conditions for an acid-catalyzed dehydration of an alcohol.\n*   **Products:** The products are an alkene with the chemical formula C30H50 and water. The formation of an alkene and water confirms that a dehydration reaction has occurred.\n*   **Rearrangement:** The question explicitly states that the reaction involves \"[1,2] shifts\". Comparing the skeleton of the reactant to the product shows a significant change in the positions of several methyl groups and the overall shape of the fused ring system. This is a classic example of a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, specifically the \"backbone rearrangement\" that converts the friedelane skeleton into the more stable oleanane skeleton.\n\n**2. The Reaction Mechanism (The Backbone Rearrangement)**\n\n1.  **Protonation and Water Loss:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) at C-3 is protonated by the acid catalyst to form a good leaving group (-OH2+). This group departs as a water molecule, generating a secondary carbocation at C-3.\n2.  **Carbocation Cascade:** This initial carbocation is unstable and triggers a cascade of sequential [1,2] shifts of neighboring hydride (H:-) and methide (CH3:-) groups. The positive charge migrates across the molecular backbone. A simplified summary of the migration is:\n    *   The positive charge moves from C-3 -> C-4 -> C-5 -> C-10 -> C-9 -> C-8 -> C-14 -> C-13.\n    *   This involves a series of seven 1,2-shifts, moving three hydrogen atoms and four methyl groups to new positions. This converts the friedelane skeleton into the oleanane skeleton.\n3.  **Elimination:** The cascade terminates when the carbocation is at C-13. A proton is then eliminated from an adjacent carbon (C-12) to form a stable tetrasubstituted double bond between C-12 and C-13. The final product is an oleanane-type alkene (specifically, it has the germanicol/δ-amyrin skeleton).\n\n**3. Determine the Substituents in the Final Product**\n\nThe question asks to identify the substituents at five labeled positions in the final oleanane product. The most reliable way to do this is to analyze the known structure of the oleanane skeleton.\n\n*   **Mapping the numbered positions:** We first map the numbered circles in the product image to their corresponding carbon atoms in the standard oleanane numbering system. The double bond is between C-12 and C-13.\n    *   **Position 1:** Located on C-4, in the α-position (pointing down, dashed bond).\n    *   **Position 2:** Located on C-10, in the β-position (pointing up, wedged bond).\n    *   **Position 3:** Located on C-9, in the α-position (pointing down, dashed bond).\n    *   **Position 4:** Located on C-8, in the β-position (pointing up, wedged bond).\n    *   **Position 5:** Located on C-14, in the α-position (pointing down, dashed bond).\n\n*   **Identifying the substituents:** Now we determine whether a hydrogen (H) or a methyl group (CH3) is present at each of these specific positions in the standard oleanane skeleton.\n    *   **Position 1 (C-4α):** In the oleanane skeleton, C-4 has a gem-dimethyl group (two methyls). The α-position is occupied by a methyl group. Thus, **1 = CH3**.\n    *   **Position 2 (C-10β):** The C-10 position in the oleanane skeleton bears a β-methyl group. Thus, **2 = CH3**.\n    *   **Position 3 (C-9α):** The C-9 position in the oleanane skeleton bears an α-hydrogen. Thus, **3 = H**.\n    *   **Position 4 (C-8β):** The C-8 position in the oleanane skeleton bears a β-methyl group. Thus, **4 = CH3**.\n    *   **Position 5 (C-14α):** The C-14 position in the oleanane skeleton bears an α-methyl group. Thus, **5 = CH3**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   Position 1: CH3\n*   Position 2: CH3\n*   Position 3: H\n*   Position 4: CH3\n*   Position 5: CH3\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = CH3>>>"
