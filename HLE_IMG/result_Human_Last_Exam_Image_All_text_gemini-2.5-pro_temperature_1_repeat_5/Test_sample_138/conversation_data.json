    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the sex of each insect. The analysis relies on common sexual dimorphism in Hymenoptera (the order that includes bees and wasps).\n\n**General Principles of Sex Determination in Bees and Wasps:**\n*   **Antennae:** Males often have longer antennae than females. In many species, males have 13 antennal segments, while females have 12. In some groups, like paper wasps, the tips of male antennae are hooked or curled.\n*   **Abdomen:** Males often have one more visible abdominal segment than females (typically 7 in males, 6 in females). The shape of the abdominal tip can also be a key indicator. Females that lay eggs in protected locations (like wood or other bees' nests) may have a pointed abdomen, and all females (except in non-stinging groups) possess a stinger (a modified ovipositor), which is absent in males.\n*   **Facial Markings:** In many bee species, males have yellow or white markings on their face (clypeus), while females have dark faces.\n*   **Pollen-Collecting Hairs (Scopae):** The question states the insects are from taxa *without* scopae. This is important because it means we cannot use the presence of large pollen loads on the hind legs to identify females, as one would with honey bees or bumble bees. This directs our attention to other features.\n\n**Analysis of Each Pair:**\n\n**Pair A: Sharp-tailed Cuckoo Bees (*Coelioxys*)**\nThese bees are cleptoparasites, laying their eggs in the nests of other bees (like leafcutter bees). As they do not provision their own nests, females lack scopae, fitting the question's description.\n*   **Insect A (Left):** This individual has a very long, sharply pointed, conical abdomen. This is the modified ovipositor of a female *Coelioxys*, used to pierce the leaf lining of a host nest. This is a **Female (F)**.\n*   **Insect A (Right):** This individual's abdomen is blunter at the tip and appears to have several small spines or prongs. This abdominal structure is characteristic of a male *Coelioxys*. This is a **Male (M)**.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The pair is Female, Male (F, M), which corresponds to option **4**.\n\n**Pair B: Paper Wasps (*Polistes*)**\nPaper wasps are social insects. They feed on nectar as adults and hunt caterpillars for their larvae. They do not have scopae.\n*   **Insect B (Left):** The most prominent feature is the antenna tip, which is clearly hooked or curled. This is a definitive characteristic of a **Male (M)** paper wasp.\n*   **Insect B (Right):** The antennae on this wasp are visible, and the tips are straight, not hooked. This indicates it is a **Female (F)** (either a worker or a queen).\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The pair is Male, Female (M, F), which corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Pair C: Hairy Bees (likely Long-horned Bees or Cuckoo Bumble Bees)**\nThe key features for identification here are the antennae and facial markings.\n*   **Insect C (Left):** This bee has extremely long antennae, significantly longer than its head. It also has a pale yellow/white patch on its face (the clypeus). Both very long antennae and a pale clypeus are classic traits of a **Male (M)** bee, particularly in the long-horned bee tribe (Eucerini).\n*   **Insect C (Right):** This bee is viewed from above. Its antennae are visible and are much shorter than those of the bee on the left, consistent with the typical length for a female bee. While its body is robust and hairy like a female long-horned bee, it could also be a female cuckoo bumble bee (*Psithyrus*), which lacks pollen-collecting structures and fits the question's premise perfectly. In either case, the short antennae identify it as a **Female (F)**.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** The pair is Male, Female (M, F), which corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Final Answer Compilation:**\n*   Pair A: F, M -> Index **4**\n*   Pair B: M, F -> Index **3**\n*   Pair C: M, F -> Index **3**\n\nCombining these indices gives the final answer.\n\n<<<4, 3, 3>>>"
