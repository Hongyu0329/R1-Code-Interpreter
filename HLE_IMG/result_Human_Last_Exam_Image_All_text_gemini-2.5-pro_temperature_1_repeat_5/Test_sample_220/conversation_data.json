    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct crystal lattice pattern.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Target Structure and Projection**\n\n*   **Crystal Structure:** We are looking for a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) structure. In an FCC unit cell, atoms are located at the eight corners and at the center of the six faces.\n*   **Viewing Direction:** The view is along the [110] direction. This means we are looking at a 2D projection of the 3D atomic arrangement onto a plane that is perpendicular to the [110] vector (this is the (110) plane).\n*   **The Resulting Pattern:** When an FCC lattice is projected along the [110] direction, the resulting 2D pattern is a **centered rectangle**. This means that atoms appear at the corners of a repeating rectangular unit cell and also at the very center of that rectangle. The ratio of the side lengths of this rectangle is âˆš2 : 1.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Each Option**\n\nWe will now examine each of the four patterns (A, B, C, D) to see which one matches the \"centered rectangle\" pattern characteristic of an FCC [110] projection.\n\n*   **Image A:** This pattern shows atoms arranged on a simple rectangular grid. There are no atoms at the centers of the rectangles formed by the grid points. This pattern is characteristic of a simple cubic (SC) lattice viewed along the [110] direction. Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Image B:** This pattern shows atoms at the corners and the center of a square unit cell. However, it also includes atoms at the center of each edge. This is the pattern of atoms found on a single (100) plane of an FCC crystal. A projection view along a direction like [100] or [110] involves stacking multiple atomic planes. The specific pattern shown in B, with the edge-centered atoms, is not the correct projection for the [110] direction. Therefore, B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Image D:** This pattern is composed of two interlocking rectangular grids that are shifted relative to each other. For this to be a centered rectangle, the shift should be exactly half the width and half the height of the rectangular unit cell. By examining the coordinates, the vertical shift between the two grids is approximately one-third of the vertical repeat distance, not one-half. Therefore, this pattern does not represent a centered rectangle. D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Image C:** This pattern appears distorted and less regular than the others. The atoms do not lie on a perfect orthogonal grid, and the bounding box is a parallelogram, suggesting the projection is shown on skewed axes. However, by eliminating the other options which represent clearly defined but incorrect patterns, C is the only remaining possibility. The complexity and apparent distortion in C can be interpreted as a more realistic or schematic representation of the centered rectangular pattern where the drawing is not perfectly to scale or aligned. One can vaguely identify a warped rectangular motif with centering atoms. For example, a distorted rectangle could be formed by atoms at approximately (1,7), (9,7), (1,14), and (9,14) (with an atom at (9,12) being close), and the atom at (5,12) could be interpreted as the displaced center atom. Given that A, B, and D are definitively incorrect representations of an FCC [110] projection, C is the most plausible answer by process of elimination.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy analyzing the expected projection pattern for an FCC lattice along the [110] direction and comparing it with the given options, we can conclude:\n*   A, B, and D represent different crystal structures, planes, or incorrect projections.\n*   C is the only option that, despite its distortion, can be considered a plausible representation of the centered rectangular pattern, primarily by eliminating the other incorrect choices.\n\n<<<C>>>"
