    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency of the circuit at node $a_0$. The node $a_0$ is part of a low-pass RC filter, where the capacitor is $C$ and the resistor is the Thevenin equivalent resistance, $R_{th}$, of the rest of the network as seen from the terminals of the capacitor (node $a_0$ and ground).\n\nThe cutoff angular frequency, $\\omega_c$, for a first-order RC low-pass filter is given by the formula:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\nThe cutoff frequency in Hertz, $f_c$, is $\\omega_c / (2\\pi)$. We will find the expression for $\\omega_c$.\n\n**2. Determine the Thevenin Equivalent Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to calculate the equivalent resistance of the circuit connected to node $a_0$ and ground. According to Thevenin's theorem, we must turn off all independent sources. The input `IN` is a voltage source at node $c_0$, so we replace it with a short circuit, meaning node $c_0$ is connected to ground.\n\n**3. Analyze the Circuit Configuration for $R_{th}$**\nThe circuit diagram shows an infinite ladder of resistors. There can be some ambiguity in interpreting the connection at node $a_0$.\n*   **Literal Interpretation:** The diagram shows a resistor `r` between node $d_1$ and node $a_0$. In this case, the Thevenin resistance would be this resistor in series with the equivalent resistance of the ladder seen from node $d_1$. So, $R_{th} = r + R_{d1,gnd}$.\n*   **Simplified Interpretation:** In many academic problems, a diagram might be drawn in a slightly simplified way. It's plausible that $a_0$ is simply the label for node $d_1$, and the line between them is a wire (zero resistance). This interpretation makes the output connection point a main node of the ladder, often leading to a more 'elegant' result. In this case, $R_{th} = R_{d1,gnd}$.\n\nWe will calculate $R_{d1,gnd}$, the resistance from node $d_1$ to ground (with $c_0$ grounded), and then decide on the most reasonable interpretation.\n\n**4. Calculate the Equivalent Resistance of the Infinite Ladder ($R_{d1,gnd}$)**\nWe can find $R_{d1,gnd}$ by injecting a test current $I$ at node $d_1$ and calculating the resulting voltage $V_{d1}$. Then, $R_{d1,gnd} = V_{d1} / I$.\n\nThe circuit is governed by a system of linear difference equations based on Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at each node. For any node $c_n$ (with $n \\ge 1$) and $d_n$ (with $n \\ge 1$), the KCL equations are:\n*   KCL at $c_n$: $3V_{cn} - V_{c(n-1)} - V_{dn} - V_{c(n+1)} = 0$\n*   KCL at $d_n$: $3V_{dn} - V_{d(n-1)} - V_{cn} - V_{d(n+1)} = 0$\n\nWe look for solutions of the form $V_{cn} = A\\lambda^n$ and $V_{dn} = B\\lambda^n$. For the voltages to decay to zero as $n \\to \\infty$, we must have $|\\lambda|<1$. Substituting these forms into the equations yields two possible modes: an \"even\" mode with $A=B$ (giving $\\lambda=1$, which does not decay) and an \"odd\" mode with $A=-B$ (giving $\\lambda^2-4\\lambda+1=0$). The decaying solution for the odd mode is $\\lambda = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe general solution is a superposition of these modes that satisfies the boundary conditions ($V_{c0}=0$ and current $I$ injected at $d_1$). The solution can be written as:\n*   $V_{cn} = K_1 + K_2 \\lambda^n$\n*   $V_{dn} = K_1 - K_2 \\lambda^n$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n1.  **KCL at $c_1$**: With $V_{c0}=0$, we have $3V_{c1} - V_{d1} - V_{c2} = 0$. Substituting the general solutions gives a relationship between the constants: $K_1 = -K_2$.\n2.  **KCL at $d_1$**: The injected current $I$ flows into the ladder from $d_1$.\n    $I = \\frac{V_{d1}-V_{c1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{d1}-V_{d2}}{r}$\n    Using $K_1=-K_2$, we have $V_{cn} = K_2(\\lambda^n-1)$ and $V_{dn}=-K_2(\\lambda^n+1)$. Substituting these into the current equation gives:\n    $I \\cdot r = K_2(\\lambda^2 - 3\\lambda)$\n    Using the fact that $\\lambda^2 - 4\\lambda + 1 = 0$, we simplify this to:\n    $I \\cdot r = K_2(\\lambda - 1)$\n\nNow we can find the resistance $R_{d1,gnd}$:\n$R_{d1,gnd} = \\frac{V_{d1}}{I} = \\frac{-K_2(\\lambda^1+1)}{K_2(\\lambda-1)/r} = \\frac{-r(\\lambda+1)}{\\lambda-1}$\n\nSubstitute $\\lambda = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$:\n$R_{d1,gnd} = \\frac{-r(2 - \\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(2 - \\sqrt{3} - 1)} = \\frac{-r(3 - \\sqrt{3})}{1 - \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{r(3 - \\sqrt{3})}{\\sqrt{3} - 1}$\n\nTo simplify, factor out $\\sqrt{3}$ from the numerator:\n$R_{d1,gnd} = \\frac{r\\sqrt{3}(\\sqrt{3} - 1)}{\\sqrt{3} - 1} = r\\sqrt{3}$\n\n**5. Final Calculation of the Cutoff Frequency**\nNow we return to the interpretation of the circuit. The result $R_{d1,gnd} = r\\sqrt{3}$ is a clean, elegant result, typical for such symmetric problems. It is highly probable that the intended problem was for the output to be taken directly at node $d_1$ (i.e., $a_0$ is the same node as $d_1$). In this case:\n$R_{th} = R_{d1,gnd} = r\\sqrt{3}$\n\nThe cutoff angular frequency $\\omega_c$ is therefore:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r\\sqrt{3} C}$\n\nIf we were to take the literal interpretation ($R_{th} = r + r\\sqrt{3}$), the result would be $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}$. The former is the more standard and expected result for this type of problem.\n\nThe cutoff frequency is thus expressed in terms of $r$ and $C$.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n*   Thevenin Resistance at $d_1$: $R_{th} = r\\sqrt{3}$\n*   Cutoff Frequency at $d_1$ (labeled as $a_0$): $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}rC}$\n\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency, which is typically denoted by $f_c = \\omega_c/(2\\pi)$. However, in circuit analysis contexts, \"frequency\" can often refer to the angular frequency $\\omega_c$. The expression will involve the same variables regardless. Let's provide the angular frequency.\n\nFinal answer expression: $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}rC}$.\n\n<<<1/(sqrt(3)*r*C)>>>"
