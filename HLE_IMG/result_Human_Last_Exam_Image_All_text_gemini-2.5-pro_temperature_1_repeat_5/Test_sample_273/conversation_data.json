    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chiral centers.**\nA chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In the given molecule, there are three such centers. Let's number the carbon atoms according to IUPAC rules to refer to them unambiguously.\n\n*   **Find the principal functional group:** The molecule contains an alcohol (-OH) group and an amine (-NH2) group. The alcohol group has higher priority, so the molecule will be named as an alkanol.\n*   **Find the longest carbon chain containing the carbon attached to the -OH group:**\n    Let's label the carbons in the drawing for clarity:\n    *   Cα: The carbon bonded to -OH and a methyl group.\n    *   Cβ: The carbon bonded to an ethyl group.\n    *   Cγ: The carbon bonded to a methyl group and a -CH₂NH₂ group.\n\n    The longest carbon chain containing Cα is a 5-carbon chain (a pentane derivative). One such chain is: CH₃(on Cα) - Cα - Cβ - Cγ - CH₂(in aminomethyl).\n*   **Number the chain:** We number the chain to give the -OH group the lowest possible locant. Numbering from the methyl group attached to Cα:\n    1.  C1: The methyl group attached to Cα.\n    2.  C2: The carbon Cα.\n    3.  C3: The carbon Cβ.\n    4.  C4: The carbon Cγ.\n    5.  C5: The carbon in the -CH₂NH₂ group.\n*   **Identify the chiral centers with their IUPAC numbers:** The chiral centers are C2, C3, and C4.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the absolute configuration (R/S) for each chiral center.**\n\n**Configuration at C2:**\n1.  **Identify the four groups attached to C2:**\n    *   -OH (hydroxyl)\n    *   -CH(C₃)(Et)(C₄...) (the rest of the chain starting at C3)\n    *   -CH₃ (methyl)\n    *   -H (hydrogen, not shown but implied)\n2.  **Assign priorities using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules:**\n    *   Priority is based on the atomic number of the atom directly bonded to the chiral center.\n    *   1. -OH (Oxygen, Z=8)\n    *   2. -C₃H(...) (Carbon, Z=6, bonded to two other carbons and a hydrogen)\n    *   3. -CH₃ (Carbon, Z=6, bonded to three hydrogens)\n    *   4. -H (Hydrogen, Z=1)\n3.  **Determine the orientation and assign configuration:**\n    *   The drawing shows the -OH group (priority 1) and the -CH₃ group (priority 3) on dashes (pointing away from the viewer).\n    *   The bond to C3 (priority 2) is in the plane of the paper.\n    *   For a tetrahedral carbon, this means the hydrogen (priority 4) must be on a wedge (pointing towards the viewer).\n    *   Since the lowest priority group (-H) is pointing towards the viewer, we determine the direction of the sequence 1 → 2 → 3 and then reverse the result.\n    *   Looking at the molecule, the sequence from -OH (1) → -C3 (2) → -CH₃ (3) traces a clockwise (CW) path.\n    *   Because the lowest priority group is on a wedge, we reverse the result. Clockwise (R) becomes Counter-clockwise (S).\n    *   **The configuration at C2 is S.**\n\n**Configuration at C3:**\n1.  **Identify the four groups attached to C3:**\n    *   -C₂H(OH)(CH₃)\n    *   -C₄H(CH₃)(CH₂NH₂)\n    *   -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl)\n    *   -H (hydrogen, implied)\n2.  **Assign priorities:**\n    *   All four groups are attached via carbon, so we look at the next atoms.\n    *   1. -C₂ (bonded to O, C, H)\n    *   2. -C₄ (bonded to C, C, N - counting the CH2NH2 group) - actually bonded to C, C, H. Let's re-evaluate: C4 is bonded to C3, H, CH3, and CH2NH2. So C4 is bonded to C, C, H.\n    *   3. -CH₂CH₃ (bonded to C, H, H)\n    *   Let's compare again:\n        *   C2 is bonded to (O, C, H).\n        *   C4 is bonded to (N, C, C, H) - atoms attached to C4 are C3, H, CH3, CH2NH2. So C4 is bonded to C(from C3), C(from Me), C(from CH2NH2), H. This is not right. C4 is bonded to C3, H, a methyl C, and a CH2 C. So C4 is bonded to (C, C, C, H).\n        *   Let's re-prioritize groups at C3:\n            *   Group -C2: C bonded to (O,C,H)\n            *   Group -C4: C bonded to (C,C,C,H) - Wait, C4 is bonded to C3, H, Me, CH2NH2. The atoms attached to C4 are C, H, C, C.\n            *   Group -Et: C bonded to (C,H,H)\n            *   Group -H: Priority 4\n        *   Comparing C2 and C4: C2 has an Oxygen, C4 does not. C2 > C4.\n        *   Comparing C4 and Et: C4 is bonded to three carbons (if we count the chain continuation through C3). C4 is bonded to C3, Me, and CH2NH2. The atoms directly attached to C4 are C, C, C, H. No, C4 is attached to C3, H, CH3, and CH2NH2. So it's bonded to one C(C3), one H, one C(CH3), one C(CH2NH2). Let's be precise. The atoms bonded to C4 are C, C, C, H. No, C4 is attached to C3, H, CH3 and CH2NH2. Let's look at what's attached to C4. It's a carbon (from C3), a hydrogen, a carbon (from methyl), and a carbon (from aminomethyl). No, the atom list is C, C, C, H.\n        * Let's look at the first shell around C3: C(from C2), C(from C4), C(from Et), H. Tie.\n        * Second shell:\n            * from C2: (O, C, H)\n            * from C4: (C, C, N) - considering the atoms on C4's neighbors. C4 is attached to a methyl(C,H,H), a C3, and a CH2NH2(C,N,H). So it's (C,C,C,N,H). Let's use the first point of difference.\n            * C4 is bonded to C,C,N,H... C(from C3), C(Me), C(CH2NH2).\n            * from Et: (C, H, H)\n        *   So, -C2 is priority 1 (due to O). Then -C4 is priority 2 (bonded to C,C,N at next level) vs -Et (bonded to C,H,H).\n    *   Priorities: 1. -C₂(OH)(CH₃), 2. -C₄(CH₃)(CH₂NH₂), 3. -CH₂CH₃, 4. -H.\n3.  **Determine the orientation and assign configuration:**\n    *   The bonds to C2 and C4 are in the plane. The bond to the ethyl group (priority 3) is on a wedge (towards viewer).\n    *   This means the hydrogen (priority 4) must be on a dash (away from viewer).\n    *   Since the lowest priority group is pointing away, we can directly read the configuration from the sequence 1 → 2 → 3.\n    *   The path from -C2 (1) → -C4 (2) → -Et (3) is clockwise (CW).\n    *   **The configuration at C3 is R.**\n\n**Configuration at C4:**\n1.  **Identify the four groups attached to C4:**\n    *   -CH₂NH₂ (aminomethyl)\n    *   -C₃H(Et)(C₂...)\n    *   -CH₃ (methyl)\n    *   -H (hydrogen, implied)\n2.  **Assign priorities:**\n    *   1. -CH₂NH₂ (The carbon is bonded to Nitrogen, Z=7)\n    *   2. -C₃(...) (Carbon bonded to C, C, C, H)\n    *   3. -CH₃ (Carbon bonded to H, H, H)\n    *   4. -H (Hydrogen, Z=1)\n3.  **Determine the orientation and assign configuration:**\n    *   The bond to C3 (priority 2) is in the plane. The bond to -CH₂NH₂ (priority 1) is on a wedge. The bond to -CH₃ (priority 3) is on a dash.\n    *   This means the hydrogen (priority 4) must be in the plane.\n    *   This is a non-standard view, so we can use a \"swap\" method. Let's swap the lowest priority group (-H, priority 4) with the group on the dash (-CH₃, priority 3).\n    *   In the new, temporary molecule: -H is on the dash, and -CH₃ is in the plane.\n    *   Now, the lowest priority group (-H) is pointing away. We can determine the configuration of this temporary molecule.\n    *   Trace the path 1 → 2 → 3.\n    *   1 (-CH₂NH₂) is on a wedge. 2 (-C₃) is in the plane. 3 (-CH₃) is in the plane.\n    *   The path from 1 (front) → 2 (left) → 3 (right-ish) is counter-clockwise (CCW).\n    *   So, the configuration of the temporary molecule is S.\n    *   Since we performed one swap to get to this temporary molecule, the configuration of the original molecule is the opposite.\n    *   **The configuration at C4 is R.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe absolute configurations of the three chiral centers, according to the IUPAC numbering C2, C3, and C4, are:\n*   C2: S\n*   C3: R\n*   C4: R\n\nThe absolute configuration of the molecule is (2S, 3R, 4R).\n\n<<< (2S, 3R, 4R) >>>"
