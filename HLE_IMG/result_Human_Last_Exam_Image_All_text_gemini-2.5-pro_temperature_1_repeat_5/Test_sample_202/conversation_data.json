    "Here is a step-by-step analysis and identification of the rock specimens.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen H**\n\n*   **Step 1: Observe Physical Characteristics.**\n    *   **Color:** The rock is reddish-brown.\n    *   **Texture:** It is highly porous with many visible holes, known as vesicles. This texture is described as vesicular.\n    *   **Overall Appearance:** It looks like a volcanic rock, somewhat lightweight and rough.\n\n*   **Step 2: Interpret the Characteristics.**\n    *   The vesicular texture indicates that the rock formed from lava that contained a lot of trapped gas bubbles. As the lava cooled quickly at the Earth's surface, the gases escaped, leaving behind the holes. This points to an extrusive igneous rock.\n    *   The reddish color is often due to the presence of iron that has oxidized (rusted).\n    *   A highly vesicular, reddish-brown volcanic rock is characteristic of scoria. It is similar to pumice but is generally denser and darker in color.\n\n*   **Identification:** **Scoria**\n\n**Analysis of Specimen I**\n\n*   **Step 1: Observe Physical Characteristics.**\n    *   **Composition:** The rock is composed of many smaller, angular pieces of different rocks (clasts) cemented together.\n    *   **Clasts:** The fragments vary in color (reddish, grey, white) and size. They have sharp, angular edges, not smooth or rounded ones.\n    *   **Matrix:** The clasts are embedded in a fine-grained, lighter-colored material that acts as a cement.\n\n*   **Step 2: Interpret the Characteristics.**\n    *   A rock made of fragments of other rocks is a clastic rock.\n    *   The angularity of the clasts indicates that the fragments were not transported far from their source before being deposited and cemented, as transport would have rounded the edges.\n    *   When the fragments are of volcanic origin (e.g., from a volcanic explosion) and are cemented together, the rock is a type of pyroclastic rock. A rock composed of large, angular volcanic fragments is called a volcanic breccia.\n\n*   **Identification:** **Volcanic Breccia**\n\n**Analysis of Specimen J**\n\n*   **Step 1: Observe Physical Characteristics.**\n    *   **Color:** The rock is very light-colored, off-white to light gray.\n    *   **Texture:** It is extremely vesicular, appearing frothy and full of tiny interconnected holes. It looks very lightweight.\n    *   **Overall Appearance:** It resembles a solidified foam or a sponge.\n\n*   **Step 2: Interpret the Characteristics.**\n    *   Like specimen H, the highly vesicular texture indicates a fast-cooling, gas-rich extrusive igneous rock.\n    *   The light color and extremely low-density, frothy appearance are the defining characteristics of pumice. Pumice is so porous that it can often float on water. It typically forms from felsic (silica-rich) lava.\n\n*   **Identification:** **Pumice**\n\n**Analysis of Specimen K**\n\n*   **Step 1: Observe Physical Characteristics.**\n    *   **Texture:** The rock is composed of large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. This is known as a coarse-grained or phaneritic texture.\n    *   **Composition:** It contains different minerals, identifiable by their different colors and lusters. There are light-colored (white/pinkish) crystals and darker (greenish/black) crystals.\n    *   **Crystal Size:** The crystals are exceptionally large.\n\n*   **Step 2: Interpret the Characteristics.**\n    *   The coarse-grained, crystalline texture indicates that the rock cooled very slowly, deep beneath the Earth's surface. This identifies it as an intrusive igneous rock.\n    *   The presence of very large crystals (typically defined as over 1 centimeter) is the key feature of a pegmatite. Pegmatites form during the final stages of a magma's crystallization, often from water-rich melts that allow ions to move freely and form large crystals. Its mineral composition is often similar to granite.\n\n*   **Identification:** **Pegmatite**\n\n---\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Volcanic Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Pegmatite\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Volcanic Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
