    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Kakuro puzzle to find the numbers in the two top white squares.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Kakuro Rules**\nThe goal is to fill the white squares with digits from 1 to 9. The numbers in the black squares are clues.\n- A clue above a column of white squares is the required sum for the digits in that column (a \"down\" clue).\n- A clue to the left of a row of white squares is the required sum for the digits in that row (an \"across\" clue).\n- A crucial rule is that within any single sum (or \"run\"), each digit must be unique. For example, a sum of 4 in two cells must be 1 and 3, not 2 and 2.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Relevant Clue for the Top Two Squares**\n1.  Locate the two top-most white squares in the puzzle grid.\n2.  These two squares form a horizontal run (an \"across\" run).\n3.  Identify the clue for this run. Looking at the black square to the upper left of this run, we see the clue `17` with a line pointing to the right, across these two squares.\n4.  This means the sum of the digits in these two squares must be 17.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Numbers Based on the Clue**\n1.  We need to find two different digits from 1 to 9 that add up to 17.\n2.  Let's list the possibilities:\n    - The highest possible digit is 9. If one number is 9, the other must be 17 - 9 = 8.\n    - The next highest digit is 8. If one number is 8, the other must be 17 - 8 = 9.\n3.  The only combination of two unique digits that sums to 17 is 8 and 9.\n\n**Step 4: Verify with Surrounding Clues (Careful Point Analysis)**\nTo be certain, we should check if this conclusion creates any contradictions with the rest of the puzzle. Let's call the left top square `A` and the right top square `B`.\n- We have `A + B = 17`, so {A, B} must be {8, 9}.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Down Clues for A and B:**\n    - The clue above square `A` is `15`. This is a \"down\" clue for the column starting with A. From the diagram, this column has 2 white squares. Let the cell below A be `D`. So, `A + D = 15`.\n    - The clue above square `B` is `29`. This is a \"down\" clue. A sum of 29 with unique digits requires at least 4 cells (e.g., 9+8+7+5 = 29), as the maximum sum for 3 cells is 9+8+7=24. The diagram is consistent with a 4-cell column. Let the cells below B be `E`, `H`, `K`. So, `B + E + H + K = 29`.\n\n2.  **Test the two possibilities for A and B:**\n    - **Case 1: A = 8, B = 9.**\n        - From `A + D = 15`, we get `8 + D = 15`, so `D = 7`.\n        - From `B + E + H + K = 29`, we get `9 + E + H + K = 29`. This means `E + H + K = 20`. This is possible (e.g., 8+7+5).\n    - **Case 2: A = 9, B = 8.**\n        - From `A + D = 15`, we get `9 + D = 15`, so `D = 6`.\n        - From `B + E + H + K = 29`, we get `8 + E + H + K = 29`. This means `E + H + K = 21`. This is also possible (e.g., 9+7+5).\n\n3.  **Introduce another row's clue to resolve the ambiguity:**\n    - The second row of white squares has an \"across\" clue `22` for its first 3 cells (let's call them `C`, `D`, `E`). So, `C + D + E = 22`.\n    - Let's re-evaluate our cases with this new information.\n        - **Case 1 (A=8, D=7):** `C + 7 + E = 22` -> `C + E = 15`. For the run C,D,E to have unique digits, C and E can't be 7. Possible pairs for {C,E} are {6,9} or {9,6}. However, E must also be a digit in the column under B, which we found could be {8,7,5}. There is no overlap between {6,9} and {8,7,5}. This case seems to have issues. A more detailed look shows that if E were 8, C would be 7, but D is already 7, which is not allowed. If E were anything else from its set, it doesn't work either. This case is impossible.\n        - **Case 2 (A=9, D=6):** `C + 6 + E = 22` -> `C + E = 16`. Possible pairs for {C,E} are {7,9} or {9,7}. E must also be from the column under B, which could be {9,7,5}. The values {7,9} are common to both sets, so this case is plausible.\n\n4.  **Encountering a Deeper Contradiction:**\n    - Further analysis of the puzzle reveals a fundamental contradiction. The second row of white squares is constrained by two clues: `22` (across, 3 cells from the left) and `5` (across, 2 cells from the right).\n    - Let the four cells in this row be `C, D, E, F`. The clues state: `C + D + E = 22` and `E + F = 5`.\n    - From `E + F = 5`, the highest possible value for E is 4 (if F=1).\n    - From `C + D + E = 22`, we have `C + D = 22 - E`. Since the maximum sum of two different digits C and D is `9 + 8 = 17`, we must have `22 - E ≤ 17`, which means `E ≥ 5`.\n    - These two conditions (`E ≤ 4` and `E ≥ 5`) are contradictory. This indicates the puzzle itself is flawed.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nDespite the flaw in the deeper parts of the puzzle, the question specifically asks for the two numbers in the top squares. This can be answered directly from the most immediate clue (`17`), which is unambiguous. The only two distinct digits that sum to 17 are 8 and 9. It is most likely that this is the intended answer, regardless of the puzzle's overall solvability.\n\nThe two numbers are 8 and 9.\n\n<<<8,9>>>"
