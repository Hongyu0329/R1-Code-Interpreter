    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the book title from the cover fragment.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements in the image fragment.**\n*   **Main Subject:** The image shows a creature that is clearly a unicorn. It has the body of a horse, is white or silvery in color, and has a single horn on its forehead. The horn appears to have a golden or brownish tint.\n*   **Appearance and Style:** The unicorn has an ethereal, glowing, and slightly transparent look, suggesting it is magical. It is depicted in motion, galloping or running from right to left. The art style is painterly, not a photograph or a sharp digital illustration.\n*   **Background:** The background is dark and indistinct, likely representing a forest at night. This dark setting makes the bright unicorn stand out.\n*   **Foreground/Framing:** On the right side of the image, there is a vertical element with warm colors (yellows, oranges, and reds). It looks like part of a decorative frame, a pillar, or a large tree trunk illuminated by a warm light source, contrasting with the cool, dark background.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate hypotheses based on the visual clues.**\n*   The central figure is a unicorn, a classic fantasy creature. Therefore, the book is almost certainly in the fantasy genre.\n*   The specific glowing, silvery appearance of the animal is a very strong clue. It is highly reminiscent of a Patronus from the Harry Potter series, which is a magical guardian that takes the form of a silvery-white animal.\n*   The most famous encounter with a unicorn in the Harry Potter series occurs in the first book, *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* (titled *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* outside the US), in the Forbidden Forest.\n\n**Step 3: Search and verify the hypothesis.**\n*   Let's investigate the cover art for the Harry Potter series, specifically the editions illustrated by Mary GrandPré, which were the original covers for the US releases. Her style matches the painterly quality of the fragment.\n*   The original US hardcover edition of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* features a wrap-around dust jacket with extensive artwork.\n*   Upon examining the full dust jacket art by Mary GrandPré, we can find this exact scene. The fragment is a detail from the back cover illustration. The full back cover art depicts the scene in the Forbidden Forest where Harry and Draco stumble upon Lord Voldemort (in a weakened form, attached to Professor Quirrell) drinking a unicorn's blood. The fragment shows another unicorn running through the trees in the background of that scene.\n*   The warm-colored pillar on the right of the fragment is part of the decorative border that frames the illustration on the back cover of the book.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the identification.**\n*   The artwork in the fragment is definitively from the back cover of the original US edition of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*, illustrated by Mary GrandPré.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
