    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The objective is to find a sequence of two moves for Black that results in checkmate, regardless of White's intervening move. A key constraint is that the black queens on a2 and b1 cannot be moved.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Position:**\n    *   The White King is on g1, in a very restricted position. The h2-pawn prevents escape to h2, and several black pieces are aimed at the kingside.\n    *   The Black Knight on f1 is a key attacking piece, being very close to the White King.\n    *   The Black Bishop on h3 controls the important g2 square and also protects the h2 square.\n    *   The Black Rook on f8 can be brought into the attack, particularly along the f-file or g-file.\n    *   The Black Queens, although immobile, exert pressure. The queen on a2 covers f2 and g2, and the queen on b1 covers the long diagonal including h1 and g2.\n\n3.  **Identify Candidate First Moves for Black:**\n    *   We are looking for a move that forces a checkmate on the next turn. Often, the best first move in such puzzles is a check, as it severely limits the opponent's replies.\n    *   Let's consider checks: `Ng3+`, `Nh2+`, `Bg2+`.\n    *   **If 1... Ng3+**: White's only legal response is `2. Kh1`. Now Black must deliver mate. The king on h1 is attacked by the queen on b1, but we cannot move the queen. Other pieces like the rook (`Rf1` is blocked by the king) or bishop cannot deliver mate in one move. So, this line fails.\n    *   **If 1... Bg2+**: White is forced to play `2. Kxg2`. The white king is now on g2. It can escape to f3 or g3. Black does not have a single move that can check the king on g2 while also covering both f3 and g3. So, this line fails.\n    *   **If 1... Nh2+**: This is the most promising move.\n        *   The White King on g1 is in check from the knight on h2.\n        *   The king cannot capture the knight (`Kxh2`) because the h2 square is defended by the Black Bishop on h3.\n        *   The king cannot move to f1 because that square is also controlled by the knight on h2.\n        *   Therefore, White has only one legal move: `2. Kh1`. The move is forced.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Position After White's Forced Move:**\n    *   After `1... Nh2+ 2. Kh1`, the White King is on h1.\n    *   We need to find a mating move for Black.\n    *   Let's check the king's escape squares:\n        *   `h2`: Controlled by the Black Knight on h2.\n        *   `g2`: Controlled by the Black Bishop on h3.\n    *   The king is trapped. All Black needs to do is deliver a check from a piece that cannot be captured or blocked.\n\n5.  **Find the Mating Move:**\n    *   The Black Rook on f8 can move to f1.\n    *   The move is `2... Rf1`.\n    *   This move places the White King in check.\n    *   The king cannot move (as established above).\n    *   The check cannot be blocked as the rook is directly adjacent to the king's rank.\n    *   The rook on f1 cannot be captured by any white piece.\n    *   Therefore, `2... Rf1#` is checkmate.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The sequence `1... Nh2+` followed by `2... Rf1#` is a forced mate in 2, and it adheres to the condition of not moving the black queens.\n\n**The sequence of Black's moves is:**\n1.  Nh2+\n2.  Rf1#\n\n<<<Nh2+, Rf1#>>>"
