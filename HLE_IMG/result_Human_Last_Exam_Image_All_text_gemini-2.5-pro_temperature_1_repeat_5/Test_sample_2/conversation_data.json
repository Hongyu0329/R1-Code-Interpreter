    "**Step-by-step analysis of the algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Structure:**\n    The provided pseudocode defines a recursive sorting function `sort(a, n)`.\n    *   `a` is the array (or list).\n    *   `n` is the size of the prefix of the array to be considered.\n    *   **Base Case:** The recursion stops when `n <= 1`. An array of size 1 or 0 is inherently sorted, and the function does nothing.\n    *   **Recursive Step (when `n > 1`):**\n        1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: This line recursively sorts the first `n-1` elements of the array, i.e., the subarray `a[0...n-2]`.\n        2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: After the first `n-1` elements are sorted, this line compares the n-th element (`a[n-1]`) with the (n-1)-th element (`a[n-2]`). Since `a[0...n-2]` is now sorted, `a[n-2]` is the largest element in that subarray.\n        3.  `swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`: If the condition in the previous step is true, it means `a[n-1]` is smaller than the largest element of the sorted prefix. The two elements are swapped.\n        4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: If a swap occurred, the sorted order of the prefix `a[0...n-2]` might be broken (because the original `a[n-1]` has been moved into it). This line calls the sort function again to re-sort the first `n-1` elements.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Time Complexity Recurrence Relation:**\n    Let `T(n)` be the time taken by the algorithm for an input of size `n`. The work done inside the function, excluding the recursive calls, is a comparison and a potential swap, which takes constant time, `O(1)`.\n\n    *   **Best Case:** Consider an already sorted array, e.g., `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.\n        *   `sort(a, n - 1)` is called.\n        *   After this call, the first `n-1` elements are sorted.\n        *   The condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` will be false (e.g., `n < n-1` is false).\n        *   The `if` block is not executed. There is no second recursive call.\n        *   The recurrence relation is `T(n) = T(n - 1) + O(1)`. This resolves to `T(n) = O(n)`.\n\n    *   **Worst Case:** We need to find an input that maximizes the execution time. This happens when the `if` condition is always true, forcing the second recursive call at every step of the recursion for `n > 1`.\n        *   Consider an array sorted in reverse order: `[n, n-1, ..., 2, 1]`.\n        *   Let's analyze `sort(a, n)` on this array.\n        *   The first call is `sort(a, n - 1)`. This will sort the prefix `a[0...n-2]`. For our initial array `[n, n-1, ..., 2]`, this will be rearranged to `[2, 3, ..., n]`. The entire array `a` becomes `[2, 3, ..., n, 1]`.\n        *   Next, the condition `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is checked. This becomes `if 1 < n`, which is true.\n        *   A swap occurs: `swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`. The array becomes `[2, 3, ..., 1, n]`.\n        *   The second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` is executed on the now-modified prefix `[2, 3, ..., 1]`. This is also a worst-case scenario for the subproblem, as the smallest element `1` is at the end.\n        *   Since both recursive calls are made, the recurrence relation for the worst case is:\n          `T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + O(1)`\n          `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where `c` is a constant)\n\n3.  **Solve the Worst-Case Recurrence Relation:**\n    We need to solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`.\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 2^2 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n    *   `T(n) = 2^2 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 2c + c = 2^3 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    *   Expanding this `k` times: `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n    *   We recurse until we reach the base case, `T(1)`. Let `n - k = 1`, so `k = n - 1`.\n    *   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-2) + ... + 1)`\n    *   The sum `1 + 2 + ... + 2^(n-2)` is a geometric series with a sum of `(2^(n-1) - 1) / (2 - 1) = 2^(n-1) - 1`.\n    *   `T(1)` is a constant. Let's call it `c'`.\n    *   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * c' + c * (2^(n-1) - 1) = c' * 2^(n-1) + c * 2^(n-1) - c = (c' + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n    *   The dominant term is `(c' + c) * 2^(n-1)`, which is of the order `O(2^n)`.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to recognize that the algorithm is recursive and to formulate the correct recurrence relation for its runtime.\n*   The key distinction between the best and worst cases lies in whether the second recursive call, `sort(a, n - 1)`, is executed.\n*   The worst-case input (like a reverse-sorted array) ensures this second call is always made.\n*   The recurrence `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c` is characteristic of processes that branch into two subproblems of nearly the same size, leading to exponential growth.\n*   The algorithm does terminate because the problem size `n` decreases with each recursive call, eventually reaching the base case `n <= 1`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe time complexity of this algorithm in the worst case is described by the recurrence `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + O(1)`, which solves to `O(2^n)`.\n\nFinal Answer is E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
