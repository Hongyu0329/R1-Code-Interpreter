    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the time signature of the given musical measure.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the time signature of the measure shown in the image. A time signature consists of two numbers. The top number tells us how many beats are in a measure, and the bottom number tells us what kind of note gets one beat. To find the time signature, we need to count the total rhythmic value of the notes and rests within the measure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Top Staff (Treble Clef)**\nThe top staff contains a series of fast notes. Let's analyze their rhythmic values. The notes are sixteenth notes (indicated by the two beams across the top of their stems).\n\n*   **Beat 1:** The first beat starts with a sixteenth rest, followed by three sixteenth notes. The total duration of this group is four sixteenth notes (1 rest + 3 notes), which is equivalent to one quarter note.\n*   **Beat 2:** The second beat consists of a sixteenth note, a sixteenth rest, and two more sixteenth notes. This group also has a total duration equivalent to four sixteenth notes, or one quarter note.\n*   **Beat 3:** The third beat is a straightforward group of four sixteenth notes. This is equivalent to one quarter note.\n*   **Beat 4:** The fourth beat is also a group of four sixteenth notes, equivalent to one quarter note.\n\n**Summary for the Top Staff:**\nBy adding the durations of all the groups, we get:\n1 quarter note + 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note = 4 quarter notes.\nThis suggests the time signature is 4/4.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Bottom Staff (Bass Clef)**\nNow, let's analyze the notes in the bottom staff to confirm our findings.\n\n*   **Note 1:** The first note is a chord. It has a filled-in notehead and a single stem, which makes it a quarter note. So, this is one quarter note beat.\n*   **Note 2:** The second note is a single note (B). It is also a quarter note. This accounts for the second quarter note beat.\n*   **Note 3:** The third note is a single note (C#). It has a hollow notehead and a stem, which makes it a half note. A half note is equal in duration to two quarter notes.\n\n**Summary for the Bottom Staff:**\nBy adding the durations of the notes in the bottom staff, we get:\n1 quarter note + 1 quarter note + 1 half note = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 quarter notes.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize and Conclude**\nBoth the top and bottom staves contain a total rhythmic value equivalent to four quarter notes. This means there are four beats in the measure, and a quarter note gets one beat. Therefore, the time signature is 4/4.\n\n**Step 5: Match with Answer Choices**\n*   A. 2/4: Incorrect. The measure contains four quarter beats, not two.\n*   B. 3/4: Incorrect. The measure contains four quarter beats, not three.\n*   C. 4/4: Correct. The measure contains four quarter beats.\n*   D. 3/8: Incorrect. This would mean three eighth notes per measure.\n*   E. 9/8: Incorrect. This would mean nine eighth notes per measure.\n\nThe analysis of the notes clearly points to 4/4 time.\n\n<<<C>>>"
