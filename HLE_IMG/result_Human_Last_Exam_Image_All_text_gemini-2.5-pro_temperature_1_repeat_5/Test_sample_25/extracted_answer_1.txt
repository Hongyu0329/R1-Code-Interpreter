The result should be interpreted as invalid. Although the curve crosses the threshold (Ct = 30.8) before the assay cut-off (40 cycles), the shape of the amplification curve is not sigmoidal. It shows a linear drift rather than a true exponential phase, which indicates the result is likely an artifact and not a true positive. The assay should be repeated.
