    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to determine its title and composer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Key Signature and Time Signature:**\n    *   The key signature has four flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db). This indicates the key of Ab major or its relative minor, F minor.\n    *   The time signature is 4/4, also known as common time.\n\n2.  **Chord Progression Analysis:**\n    *   The piece begins and ends on an F chord (starting with F minor, ending on F major). This strongly suggests the overall key is F minor.\n    *   **First A Section (Bars 1-8):** The progression starts with `| F- | Eø7 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7 | C7 | F- |...`. The descending bass line implied by the chords `F` -> `E` -> `Eb` is a very distinctive feature in jazz standards. `Eø7` (E half-diminished 7th) acts as a passing chord.\n    *   **Bridge (B Section, Bars 9-16):** The progression moves to `| Dø7 | G7 | C7 | F7 | Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab | G C7 |`. This sequence of ii-V-I progressions (or variations thereof) is typical for a bridge in a 32-bar AABA form standard. It modulates temporarily before leading back to the home key.\n    *   **Final A Section (Bars 17-24):** The progression returns to the initial theme: `| F | Eø7 | Eb-6 | Db | G7 | C7 | F |`. Note that the first and last chords of this section are F major, a common harmonic device called a \"Picardy third,\" where a minor piece resolves to a major chord.\n\n3.  **Melody Analysis:**\n    *   The melody begins on the note C over an F minor chord. The first few notes are C, F, G, Gb, F.\n    *   This melodic contour, combined with the underlying harmony, is highly characteristic.\n\n4.  **Identification:**\n    *   The unique combination of the F minor key, the chromatic descending bass line in the A section (`Fm -> Eø7 -> Eb6`), the specific melody, and the AABA-like structure are all hallmarks of the jazz standard **\"Yesterdays\"**.\n    *   A check against known information confirms that \"Yesterdays\" has this exact chord progression and melody.\n\n5.  **Composer Identification:**\n    *   The composer of the music for \"Yesterdays\" is **Jerome Kern**. The lyrics were written by Otto Harbach for the 1933 musical \"Roberta\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Handwritten charts like this one may contain slight variations from the \"official\" version. For example, the chord in the third measure is written as `Eb-6` (E-flat minor sixth), while some versions use `Eb6` (E-flat major sixth). Functionally, they are similar in this context.\n*   The chord in bar 11 is `C7`, while some versions might use `Cm` or `Cm7`. The `C7` serves as a secondary dominant leading to the `F7` in the next bar.\n*   The key signature and the starting chord are the most crucial initial clues for identifying a tune.\n*   Recognizing common harmonic patterns (like the chromatic descent or the ii-V-I sequences in the bridge) is key to identifying jazz standards.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the melody and harmony, the piece is identified as the jazz standard \"Yesterdays\", composed by Jerome Kern.\n\n<<<Title: Yesterdays, Composer: Jerome Kern>>>"
