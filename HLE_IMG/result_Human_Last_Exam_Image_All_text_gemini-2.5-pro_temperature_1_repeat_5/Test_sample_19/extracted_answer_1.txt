1.  The music modulates to the key of **B minor**.
2.  The new key, B minor, is the **subtonic minor** (built on the 7th degree of the natural minor scale) of the home key, C# minor. The modulation is justified by a harmonic sequence of descending fourths (A major → E minor → B minor) which smoothly leads to the new key center.
3.  The complete and accurate Roman numeral marking for the chord is **iv/iv** (the subdominant of the subdominant).
