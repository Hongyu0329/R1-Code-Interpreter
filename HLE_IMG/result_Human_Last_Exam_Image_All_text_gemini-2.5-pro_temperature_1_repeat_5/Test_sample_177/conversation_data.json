    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by comparing the \"Baseline\" scenario in Table 1 with the \"Proposed\" scenario in Table 2.\n\n**2. Define Car VMT**\nVMT stands for Vehicle Miles Traveled. \"Car VMT\" refers to the total miles traveled by all cars, regardless of the number of occupants. Therefore, for each distance category, we must sum the mode shares of \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\" to get the total mode share for cars (as vehicles). The \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" data is not needed for this calculation.\n\n**3. Formulate the Calculation**\nTo find the total VMT, we need to consider both the mode share for cars and the distribution of trips by distance. We can calculate a weighted VMT value (or \"VMT Index\") for each scenario. This index represents the average VMT per trip across all distance categories.\n\nThe formula for the VMT Index for one scenario is:\n`VMT Index = Σ [ (Share of total trips_i) × (Total car mode share_i) × (Average trip distance_i) ]`\nwhere `i` represents each of the four distance categories (0-3 miles, 3-5 miles, etc.).\n\n**4. Calculate the Baseline Car VMT Index (from Table 1)**\n\n*   **For 0-3 miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 48% (0.48)\n    *   Total car mode share: 25% + 28% = 53% (0.53)\n    *   Average trip distance: 1 mile\n    *   Contribution to VMT Index: `0.48 × 0.53 × 1 = 0.2544`\n\n*   **For 3-5 miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 22% (0.22)\n    *   Total car mode share: 38% + 43% = 81% (0.81)\n    *   Average trip distance: 4 miles\n    *   Contribution to VMT Index: `0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = 0.7128`\n\n*   **For 5-10 miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 14% (0.14)\n    *   Total car mode share: 40% + 45% = 85% (0.85)\n    *   Average trip distance: 7.5 miles\n    *   Contribution to VMT Index: `0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = 0.8925`\n\n*   **For 10+ miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 16% (0.16)\n    *   Total car mode share: 42% + 47% = 89% (0.89)\n    *   Average trip distance: 20 miles\n    *   Contribution to VMT Index: `0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = 2.848`\n\n*   **Total Baseline VMT Index:**\n    `VMT_Baseline = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.848 = 4.7077`\n\n**5. Calculate the Proposed Car VMT Index (from Table 2)**\n\n*   **For 0-3 miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 48% (0.48)\n    *   Total car mode share: 1% + 2% = 3% (0.03)\n    *   Average trip distance: 1 mile\n    *   Contribution to VMT Index: `0.48 × 0.03 × 1 = 0.0144`\n\n*   **For 3-5 miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 22% (0.22)\n    *   Total car mode share: 8% + 19% = 27% (0.27)\n    *   Average trip distance: 4 miles\n    *   Contribution to VMT Index: `0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = 0.2376`\n\n*   **For 5-10 miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 14% (0.14)\n    *   Total car mode share: 14% + 27% = 41% (0.41)\n    *   Average trip distance: 7.5 miles\n    *   Contribution to VMT Index: `0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = 0.4305`\n\n*   **For 10+ miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 16% (0.16)\n    *   Total car mode share: 16% + 33% = 49% (0.49)\n    *   Average trip distance: 20 miles\n    *   Contribution to VMT Index: `0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = 1.568`\n\n*   **Total Proposed VMT Index:**\n    `VMT_Proposed = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.568 = 2.2505`\n\n**6. Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\nThe formula for percentage reduction is:\n`% Reduction = ( (VMT_Baseline - VMT_Proposed) / VMT_Baseline ) × 100`\n\n*   `% Reduction = ( (4.7077 - 2.2505) / 4.7077 ) × 100`\n*   `% Reduction = ( 2.4572 / 4.7077 ) × 100`\n*   `% Reduction = 0.52195... × 100`\n*   `% Reduction ≈ 52.2%`\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
