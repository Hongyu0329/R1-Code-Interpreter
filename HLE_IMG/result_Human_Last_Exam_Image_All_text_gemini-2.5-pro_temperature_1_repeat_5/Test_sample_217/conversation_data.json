    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual representation of the cuneiform sign.**\n    The image provided is a line drawing of an ancient cuneiform sign. The sign is composed of several elements. The main body is a rectangle, standing vertically. Inside this rectangle, there are a series of nested L-shapes or angular lines. On top of the rectangle is a triangular shape, resembling a roof. There are also small horizontal and vertical strokes attached to the sides and top of the main structure. Visually, the entire sign strongly resembles a schematic drawing of a building, specifically a house or a hut with a roof.\n\n*   **Step 2: Consider the context provided in the question.**\n    The question asks for the meaning of this sign in its \"third-millennium form.\" This specifies a particular historical period (3000-2001 BCE), during which Sumerian civilization flourished. The style of the sign, being more pictographic than the later, more abstract wedge-based forms, is consistent with this era.\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate the given answer choices against the visual evidence and historical context.**\n    *   **A. Tool:** A sign for a tool would likely be a pictograph of that specific tool (e.g., a plow, a sickle). The image does not resemble a common tool.\n    *   **B. Guard:** This is an abstract concept. While cuneiform has signs for abstract ideas, a sign with such a clear pictographic origin as a building is less likely to primarily mean \"guard.\"\n    *   **C. Bread:** The cuneiform sign for bread (NINDA) is a pictograph, but it typically looks like a bowl or a specific shape of a loaf, which is different from the sign shown.\n    *   **D. Home:** This choice aligns perfectly with the visual evidence. The sign is a classic pictograph of a house or dwelling. In the Sumerian language, this sign is read as **Ã‰** and means \"house,\" \"temple,\" or \"home.\"\n    *   **E. Deity:** The determinative and logogram for \"deity\" or \"god\" (DINGIR) is a star-like symbol (ð’€­), which looks completely different from the sign in the image.\n    *   **F. Beard:** The sign for \"beard\" (SU) is usually depicted in conjunction with the sign for \"head\" and looks like a stylized representation of a beard on a chin, which is morphologically distinct from the sign in question.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude based on the analysis.**\n    The cuneiform sign shown is the Sumerian logogram **Ã‰**. Its pictographic origin is a representation of a house. Therefore, its meaning is \"house\" or \"home.\" This is one of the most fundamental and recognizable signs from the early periods of cuneiform writing.\n\n<<<D>>>"
