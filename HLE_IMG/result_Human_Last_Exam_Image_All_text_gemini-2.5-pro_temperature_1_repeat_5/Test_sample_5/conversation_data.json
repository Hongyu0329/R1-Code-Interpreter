    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Instrumentation and General Form:** The music is written on a grand staff (treble and bass clefs connected by a brace), which is standard notation for piano music.\n2.  **Key and Time Signature:** The key signature has four sharps (F#, C#, G#, D#), indicating either E major or C# minor. The consistent use of C# minor chords and harmonic progressions (like the B# diminished chord in measure 4, which functions as a G# dominant 7th) firmly establishes the key as C# minor. The time signature is 4/4 (common time).\n3.  **Tempo and Dynamics:** The tempo is marked at a quarter note = 80 (♩ = 80), a moderate Andante tempo. There are significant and abrupt dynamic shifts, starting with *p* (piano, soft) in measure 1, jumping to *f* (forte, loud) in measure 3, then changing to *mp* (mezzo-piano, moderately soft) in measure 4 and *mf* (mezzo-forte, moderately loud) in measure 8. This wide dynamic range and sudden changes are characteristic of dramatic, expressive music.\n4.  **Musical Content and Texture:**\n    *   **Measures 1-2:** The piece opens with a simple, quiet melodic phrase in the right hand over sustained octaves in the left hand. This section is lyrical and subdued.\n    *   **Measures 3-12:** There is a dramatic change in character. The music becomes loud, fast, and virtuosic. The texture consists of rapid sixteenth-note broken chords and arpeggios, creating a feeling of agitation and storminess.\n    *   Specifically, the right-hand chords over the left-hand broken octaves starting in measure 4, the rapid arpeggio run in measure 7, and the upward rushing figure in measure 11 are highly characteristic figures.\n5.  **Identification:**\n    *   The combination of the C# minor key, the 4/4 time signature, and the agitated, virtuosic character of the main section (from measure 3 onwards) strongly points to the third movement (*Presto agitato*) of Ludwig van Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 14, Op. 27, No. 2.\n    *   This sonata is famously nicknamed the \"Moonlight\" Sonata.\n    *   Comparing the notes and rhythms from measure 3 onwards with the score of the \"Moonlight\" Sonata's third movement reveals an exact match. The powerful main theme, the transitional passages, and the dramatic flourishes are all present.\n6.  **Addressing Anomalies:** The first two quiet measures are not part of Beethoven's original score for the third movement, which begins directly with the loud, fast arpeggios. These measures may have been added as an introduction in this particular edition. Similarly, the tempo marking of ♩ = 80 is much slower than a typical performance of a *Presto agitato* movement, but this doesn't change the identity of the notes themselves. The core musical material is unmistakably from the \"Moonlight\" Sonata.\n\n**Conclusion:** The piece is the third movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 14, \"Moonlight\".\n\n<<<Beethoven - Piano Sonata No. 14 \"Moonlight\" 3rd Movement>>>"
