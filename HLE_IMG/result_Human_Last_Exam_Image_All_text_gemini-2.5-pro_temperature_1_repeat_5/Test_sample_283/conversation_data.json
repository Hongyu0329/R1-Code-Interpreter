    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the country based on the Google Trends graph.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Graph's Structure and Data**\n\n*   **X-Axis (Time):** The graph spans from December 2019 to after May 2023. This covers approximately 3.5 years.\n*   **Y-Axis (Search Interest):** This shows the relative popularity of search terms on a scale of 0 to 100, where 100 represents the peak popularity over the given period.\n*   **Data Lines (Three Events):** There are three lines (red, blue, and yellow), each representing the search interest for a different historic event.\n*   **Key Pattern:** All three lines exhibit a distinct cyclical pattern with peaks occurring at roughly the same time each year. This is a strong indicator that the search terms are related to annual holidays, festivals, or anniversaries.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Timing of the Annual Peaks for Each Event**\n\nBy observing the graph year by year, we can pinpoint the approximate time each event's search interest peaks.\n\n*   **Red Line:** This line shows the largest and most consistent peaks. They occur every year around **late January to early February**.\n    *   Peak 1: ~January/February 2020\n    *   Peak 2: ~January/February 2021\n    *   Peak 3: ~February 2022\n    *   Peak 4: ~January 2023\n*   **Blue Line:** This line has smaller but very regular peaks that occur every year in **early April**.\n    *   Peak 1: ~April 2020\n    *   Peak 2: ~April 2021\n    *   Peak 3: ~April 2022\n    *   Peak 4: ~April 2023\n*   **Yellow Line:** This line shows sharp peaks that occur annually around **early to mid-June**.\n    *   Peak 1: ~June 2020\n    *   Peak 2: ~June 2021\n    *   Peak 3: ~June 2022\n    *   Peak 4: ~June 2023 (This peak is the highest on the entire chart, reaching 100).\n\n**Step 3: Hypothesize the Events and the Associated Country**\n\nWe need to find a single country that has three major national/historical events or festivals that correspond to these three specific time frames.\n\n1.  **Event 1 (Red Line - Late Jan/Feb):** This timing is characteristic of the **Lunar New Year**. This is celebrated in many East and Southeast Asian countries. In China, it is the most important festival, known as the **Spring Festival**. This would explain why the red line has the highest search interest.\n\n2.  **Event 2 (Blue Line - Early April):** Combining the hypothesis of China from the first event, we can look for a major Chinese festival in early April. The **Qingming Festival**, or Tomb-Sweeping Day, is a traditional Chinese festival and public holiday. It falls on the 15th day after the Spring Equinox, which is always on **April 4th or 5th**. This matches the timing of the blue peaks perfectly.\n\n3.  **Event 3 (Yellow Line - Mid-June):** Continuing with the China hypothesis, we look for a festival in June. The **Dragon Boat Festival** (Duanwu Festival) is another major traditional holiday in China. It is celebrated on the 5th day of the 5th month of the Chinese lunisolar calendar, which typically falls in **June**. This aligns perfectly with the timing of the yellow peaks.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude and Verify**\n\n*   The three events are almost certainly the **Spring Festival (Chinese New Year)**, the **Qingming Festival**, and the **Dragon Boat Festival**.\n*   All three are major historical and cultural festivals celebrated throughout **China**.\n*   The relative search interest also makes sense: The Spring Festival (red) is the largest and most significant holiday, followed by the other two major traditional festivals.\n*   A historian would readily recognize these three festivals as cornerstones of Chinese cultural history and tradition.\n\nTherefore, the country in question is China.\n\n<<<China>>>"
