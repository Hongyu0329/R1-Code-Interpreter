    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the image.**\n    The image is a photograph of an ancient Greek vase, specifically a red-figure Apulian pelike. The scene depicted is a dramatic one involving a chariot. We can see:\n    *   A chariot with one visible wheel.\n    *   A portion of a white horse pulling the chariot.\n    *   Two figures inside the chariot. The one driving wears a patterned bodysuit and a Phrygian cap, common for depicting \"eastern\" or non-Greek figures like Amazons, or supernatural beings. This figure holds a goad. The other figure is a woman in flowing robes.\n    *   A large white wing is visible above the driver, suggesting a supernatural event or a winged being.\n    *   A naked male figure lies on the ground in front of the chariot, appearing to have been thrown from it. His body is contorted as if in death or severe injury.\n    *   The base of the vase has a decorative wave-like pattern.\n\n*   **Step 2: Interpret the action in the scene.**\n    The central action is a chariot crash. The male figure on the ground has clearly been ejected from the chariot, which is being driven frantically by a non-human or foreign-looking character. The term \"leaving the chariot\" most accurately describes the fate of the man on the ground, who has left it involuntarily and violently.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the mythological story.**\n    This scene is a well-known depiction of a specific Greek myth. A fatal chariot crash instigated by a divine curse points to the story of Hippolytus.\n    *   **The Myth:** Hippolytus, the son of King Theseus of Athens, was a chaste youth devoted to the goddess Artemis. He scorned Aphrodite, the goddess of love. In revenge, Aphrodite caused Hippolytus's stepmother, Phaedra, to fall in love with him. When he rejected her, she killed herself, leaving a note falsely accusing him of assault. The enraged Theseus, believing the lie, used one of three curses given to him by his father, the sea-god Poseidon, to punish his son. As Hippolytus drove his chariot by the sea, Poseidon sent a bull from the waves. The horses panicked, overturned the chariot, and dragged Hippolytus to his death.\n    *   **Matching the myth to the image:** The figure on the ground is the tragic hero **Hippolytus**, dragged to his death after being thrown from his chariot. The figure driving the chariot is often identified as **Lyssa**, the personification of madness or frenzy, sent to drive the horses wild. The wing may belong to her, signifying her divine nature.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude the identity of the figure.**\n    Based on the analysis of the scene and its correspondence with the myth of Hippolytus, the figure who is \"leaving the chariot\" (i.e., being thrown from it and lying on the ground) is Hippolytus.\n\n<<<Hippolytus>>>"
