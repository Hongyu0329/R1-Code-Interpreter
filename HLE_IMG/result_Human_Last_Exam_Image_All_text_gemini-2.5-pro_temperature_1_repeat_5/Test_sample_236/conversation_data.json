    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the image to identify the subject.**\n    The main subject of the image is an insect resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is in the center of the frame and is the most in-focus element.\n\n*   **Step 2: Observe the key features of the insect.**\n    *   **Order:** The insect has a characteristic \"true bug\" appearance, with partially hardened forewings (hemelytra), a triangular scutellum (the small triangle behind the pronotum), and long antennae. This places it in the order Hemiptera.\n    *   **Coloration:** The insect is primarily black with distinct reddish-orange markings. There is an orange band behind the head on the pronotum, and the edges of its wings are also lined with the same reddish-orange color.\n    *   **Shape and Body Parts:** It has an elongated, somewhat flattened oval body. The head is black with large compound eyes. The antennae are long, segmented, and black. The legs are also black.\n    *   **Habitat/Context:** The insect is on a yellow flowering plant, which appears to be a species of goldenrod (*Solidago*). This provides a clue about its habitat and the time of year (late summer or fall).\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the insect based on its features.**\n    The combination of black and reddish-orange coloration, the specific pattern of the markings (lines on the thorax and outlining the wings), and the overall body shape are highly characteristic of the **Boxelder Bug**. These bugs are common in North America and are well-known for their distinct appearance. While they primarily feed on the seeds of boxelder, maple, and ash trees, adults are often seen congregating in large numbers or feeding on various plants, like goldenrod, in the fall before seeking shelter for the winter.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the scientific name.**\n    The scientific name for the Boxelder Bug is a binomial name consisting of the genus and species. The correct scientific name for this insect is *Boisea trivittata*.\n\n*   **Step 5: Review and confirm.**\n    *   **Insect:** Boxelder Bug.\n    *   **Features:** Black with red/orange linear markings on the thorax and wing edges. Matches the image.\n    *   **Scientific Name:** *Boisea trivittata*.\n    The analysis confirms the identification.\n\n<<<Boisea trivittata>>>"
