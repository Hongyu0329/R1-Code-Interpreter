The structures of the three products A, B, and C are as follows:

*   **Product A (C14H20N2O3):**
    This product is formed from the [3+2] cycloaddition of the azomethine ylide (generated by decarboxylation of the starting material) with methyl propiolate, followed by tautomerization of the imine substituent to an enamine, and subsequent N-acylation with acetic anhydride.
    Its structure is 7-[1-acetyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-5-yl]-3-(methoxycarbonyl)-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene.
     

*   **Product B (C12H14N2O3):**
    This product is also formed from the initial [3+2] cycloadduct, which then undergoes a more complex transformation involving rearrangement, dehydrogenation (-4H), and oxidation (+O). The bicyclic system rearranges to a more stable, conjugated dihydropyrrolizine system, and the substituent ring is oxidized to a lactam (pyrrolidinone).
    Its structure is 7-(2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl)-5-(methoxycarbonyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolizine.
     

*   **Product C (C11H16N2O3):**
    This product is formed by a side reaction where the starting material itself does not undergo cycloaddition. Instead, its imine substituent tautomerizes to an enamine, which is then N-acetylated by acetic anhydride.
    Its structure is 1-(1-acetyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-5-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid.
