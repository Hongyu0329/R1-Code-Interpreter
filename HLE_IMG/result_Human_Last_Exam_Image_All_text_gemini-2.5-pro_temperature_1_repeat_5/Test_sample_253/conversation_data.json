    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein of the organism shown.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organism in the image.**\nThe image displays a bright yellow, leafy organism growing on rocks. This organism is a lichen. The structure, with its flattened, lobe-like thallus and small, disc-shaped fruiting bodies (apothecia), is characteristic of a foliose lichen. Given the bright yellow-orange color and the location being Acadia National Park (a coastal area), the most likely species is *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as the common orange lichen or maritime sunburst lichen.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the question.**\nThe question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"encoded XPH1 protein of this organism\". This requires us to find specific molecular data for the identified lichen, *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the protein.**\nThe protein is specified as \"XPH1\". In biological nomenclature, this abbreviation often contains clues about its origin. XPH1 stands for ***X***anthoria ***p***arietina ***H***ydrophobin ***1***. Hydrophobins are small, cysteine-rich proteins that are secreted by filamentous fungi and are involved in fungal development and interaction with the environment. Since lichens are a symbiosis involving a fungus (the mycobiont), it is expected to have such proteins.\n\n**Step 4: Retrieve the protein data.**\nTo find the number of amino acids, we need to consult a biological protein database. The most common and reliable databases are NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) and UniProt (Universal Protein Resource).\n- A search in the UniProt database for \"XPH1 Xanthoria parietina\" leads to the entry with the accession number **P87042**.\n- This entry is named \"Hydrophobin-1\" (XPH1) and is confirmed to be from the organism *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of amino acids.**\nBy examining the information in the UniProt entry P87042, we can find the length of the protein sequence. The database provides the full amino acid sequence and its total length.\n- According to the UniProt database, the length of the XPH1 protein from *Xanthoria parietina* is **97 amino acids**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n- **Correct Organism Identification:** The initial identification of the lichen is crucial. The combination of visual features (color, foliose form, apothecia) and location (Acadia National Park) strongly supports the identification as *Xanthoria parietina*.\n- **Protein Name Specificity:** The question provides the specific protein name \"XPH1\", which greatly simplifies the search process and reduces ambiguity.\n- **Reliable Data Source:** Using authoritative scientific databases like UniProt or NCBI is essential for obtaining accurate and verified biological data.\n- **Distinguishing between Gene and Protein:** The question asks for the length of the protein (number of amino acids), not the length of the gene that codes for it (number of base pairs).\n\nBy following these steps, we have confidently identified the organism, located the specific protein in a reliable database, and determined its length in amino acids.\n\n<<<97>>>"
