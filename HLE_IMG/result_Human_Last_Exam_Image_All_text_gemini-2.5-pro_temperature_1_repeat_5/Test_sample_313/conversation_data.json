    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the image.**\n*   **Clue:** \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   **Image Analysis:** The image shows two men in suits at what appears to be an awards ceremony. The younger man, with a beard, is receiving a trophy from an older man with white/grey hair.\n*   **Identification:** Through visual recognition and searching for events on or around the given date, the men can be identified. The younger man is Russian professional ice hockey player Nikita Kucherov. The older man is the commissioner of the National Hockey League (NHL), Gary Bettman.\n*   **Event Identification:** The event is the 2019 NHL Awards ceremony. This ceremony took place on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas. The date in the prompt is off by one day, which is a minor discrepancy common in such puzzles.\n*   **Interpretation:** The image's primary purpose is to identify the event: the 2019 NHL Awards. The phrase \"X Y is pictured at an event\" means that \"X Y\" is something associated with this event. It is not necessarily the specific person or trophy shown in this exact frame.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   **Clue:** \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   **Interpretation:** This clue points to a term, \"X Y\", which is also the name of a substance or product containing mercury salts that is no longer in common use because of its toxicity.\n*   **Historical Context:** Research into historical uses of mercury salts reveals a few prominent examples:\n    1.  **Calomel (Mercurous Chloride, Hg₂Cl₂):** A very common medicine used as a purgative and for other ailments from the 16th to the early 20th century. Its use was discontinued due to severe side effects caused by mercury poisoning.\n    2.  **Felt Hat Manufacturing:** Mercuric nitrate was used in a process called \"carroting\" to treat fur for making felt hats. This led to neurological damage in hat-makers, coining the phrase \"mad as a hatter.\"\n    3.  **Vermilion Pigment:** A brilliant red pigment made from mercury sulfide. Its use has been largely replaced by modern, less toxic pigments.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the two clues to find \"X Y\".**\n*   We need to find a name (\"X Y\") that is connected to the 2019 NHL Awards (from Clue 1) and also has a homophone or is the same name as one of the historical mercury products (from Clue 2).\n*   Let's examine the names of the trophies awarded at the NHL Awards: Hart Trophy, Ted Lindsay Award, Vezina Trophy, James Norris Trophy, Frank J. Selke Trophy, **Calder Memorial Trophy**, Lady Byng Trophy, etc.\n*   Now, we compare these names with the mercury-related terms.\n*   The name **\"Calder\"** is phonetically very similar to **\"Calomel\"**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the connection.**\n*   **X Y (from the event):** The **Calder Trophy**. The Calder Memorial Trophy is awarded annually at the NHL Awards to the league's rookie of the year. It was indeed a part of the 2019 NHL Awards ceremony identified from the image.\n*   **\"Another X Y\" (from the mercury clue):** **Calomel**. This mercury-based medicine fits the description of having \"almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts\" perfectly.\n*   The link between \"Calder\" and \"Calomel\" is strong and fits all parts of the puzzle. While the man pictured, Nikita Kucherov, won the Hart Trophy and others, not the Calder Trophy (which went to Elias Pettersson), the clue refers to the event as a whole, where the Calder Trophy was present and awarded.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe term \"X Y\" refers to the Calder Trophy.\n\n<<<Calder Trophy>>>"
